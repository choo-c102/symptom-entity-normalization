       "  'AB': \"BACKGROUND: Pancreatic cancer is the twelfth most common cancer worldwide, but high mortality rates make it the sixth leading cause of cancer deaths. Diagnosis is frequently too late for curative intervention. Risk assessment tools incorporating diagnostic prediction models may assist early pancreatic cancer detection by primary care clinicians. AIM AND METHODS: This mixed methods systematic review aims to identify risk assessment tools which can be used for the detection of pancreatic cancer and have been investigated in primary care. It also seeks to synthesise the qualitative and quantitative evidence relating to the patient and clinician perspectives and experiences with these tools. RESULTS: Ten studies were included with five risk assessment tools identified: 'QCancer', 'eRATs' (electronic risk assessment tools), 'CaDet', 'Future Health Today' and 'C the Signs'. No tools were found for pancreatic cancer alone. Thematic synthesis of stakeholder perspectives resulted in three themes: impact on clinical decision-making, impact on patient consultations and implementation barriers and facilitators. Overall, experiences and impacts were positive, especially if used by less experienced clinicians. CONCLUSION: There is little evidence for the inclusion of many developed pancreatic cancer diagnostic prediction models in risk assessment tools in primary care, and limited research into stakeholder perceptions, especially patient perceptions. This review can inform future tool development, and further research should be undertaken assessing these tools' clinical validity to encourage uptake in clinical practice.

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Immune checkpoint blockers (ICBs) have revolutionized cancer therapy, yet they remain largely ineffective in treating pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Moreover, ICBs can cause severe immune-related adverse events (irAEs), including fatal cardiac toxicity. Finally, obesity is a risk factor in PDAC that may differentially modulate ICB efficacy in a malignancy-dependent manner. METHODS: We investigated the mechanisms underlying irAEs induced by dual ICB therapy and sought to identify strategies to mitigate them while improving ICB efficacy in the obese setting. To this end, we used a clinically relevant mouse model that integrated key features of human PDAC: (1) high-fat diet-induced obesity, (2) an orthotopic PDAC, and (3) a therapeutic regimen combining chemotherapy (FOLFIRINOX) with ICBs (alpha-programmed cell death protein-1 + alpha-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein-4 antibodies). RESULTS: Obese mice developed cardiac irAEs and had elevated serum interleukin (IL)-1beta levels after chemoimmunotherapy. IL-1beta blockade not only prevented myocarditis and reduced cardiac fibrosis but also enhanced the antitumor efficacy of the combination of chemotherapy plus dual ICB therapy and significantly improved the overall survival of PDAC-bearing obese mice. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide the rationale and compelling data to test a Food and Drug Administration-approved anti-IL-1beta antibody in combination with chemotherapy and dual ICB therapy in patients with pancreatic cancer with obesity.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'PURPOSE: This randomized phase-II trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02767557) compared efficacy of gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel (Gem/Nab) with or without the anti-interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor antibody tocilizumab (Toc) for advanced pancreatic cancer (PC). METHODS: A safety cohort received Gem 1,000 mg/m(2) and Nab 125 mg/m(2) on days 1, 8, and 15, and Toc 8 mg/kg on day 1 for each 28-day cycle. Participants with modified Glasgow prognostic scores of 1 or 2 were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive Gem/Nab/Toc or Gem/Nab. The primary end point was the overall survival (OS) rate at 6 months (OS6). Secondary end points were progression-free survival (PFS), overall response rate (ORR), and safety. Exploratory end points were cachexia, quality of life, and biomarkers, including the cachexia-promoting protein, growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15). RESULTS: Overall, 147 patients were treated, including six safety cohort participants. The median follow-up period was 8.1 months (IQR, 4.2-13.9). OS6 was 68.6% (95% CI, 56.3 to 78.1) for the Gem/Nab/Toc group and 62.0% (49.6-72.1) for the Gem/Nab group (P = .409). OS for Gem/Nab/Toc versus Gem/Nab improved at 18 months (27.1% v 7.0%, P = .001). No differences in median OS, PFS, or ORR were observed. Incidence of grade-3+ treatment-related adverse events (TrAEs) was 88.1% for Gem/Nab/Toc and 63.4% for Gem/Nab (P < .001). Gem/Nab/Toc decreased muscle loss versus Gem/Nab, with median change +0.1013% versus -3.430% (P = .0012) at 2 months and +0.7044 versus -3.353% (P = .036) at 4 months. Incidence of muscle loss was 43.48% on Gem/Nab/Toc versus 73.52% on Gem/Nab at 2 months (P = .0045) and 41.82% versus 68.75% (P = .0062) at 4 months. GDF15 was not changed by Gem/Nab or Gem/Nab/Toc. CONCLUSION: Although the primary end point was not met and TrAEs were increased by Toc, increased survival at 18 months and reduced muscle wasting support an anticachexia effect of IL-6 blockade independent of GDF15. Further studies could leverage these findings for precision anticachexia therapy.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly aggressive malignancy with dismal prognosis. PDAC develops in a hypoxic environment in which cells adapt and activate processes to allow survival under low-oxygen conditions, some of which may enhance the ability of cancer cells to invade locally or metastasize distantly. Using human PDAC organoids, we determined that hypoxia consistently enhanced invasion across 11 patient-derived models. Using RNA sequencing of hypoxic invasive organoids (compared with matched invasive normoxic organoids from the same patients), we identified prolyl 4-hydroxylase subunit alpha 1 (P4HA1) as a potential regulator of PDAC invasion in hypoxia. Leveraging publicly available datasets from human tissue, we determined that P4HA1 is more highly expressed in PDAC compared with normal pancreatic tissue and that high P4HA1 expression correlates with poor patient prognosis. To further interrogate the role of P4HA1 in invasion of hypoxic patient-derived organoids, we quantified invasion in organoids modified to knockdown or overexpress P4HA1, demonstrating that P4HA1 is necessary for hypoxia-enhanced invasion and sufficient to increase invasion in normoxia in PDAC organoids. Our results identify P4HA1 as a driver of PDAC organoid invasion in hypoxia. SIGNIFICANCE: This study demonstrates that hypoxia increases invasion across a cohort of human pancreatic cancer organoids and identifies the collagen-modifying enzyme P4HA1 as a driver of hypoxia-enhanced invasion. These results characterize a molecular mechanism by which the microenvironment alters tumor cell behavior and underscore new strategies to inhibit invasion.',\n",

       "  'AB': \"OBJECTIVE: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is characterized by a low survival rate and limited responsiveness to current therapies. The role of hypoxia in the tumor microenvironment is critical, influencing tumor progression and therapy resistance. The aim of this study was to implement the complex dynamics of the hypoxic tumor microenvironment in PDAC in a hypoxia-related prognosis model. METHODS: We utilized single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data and integrated it with TCGA-PAAD database to identify hypoxia-responsive macrophage subsets and related genes. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, Cox regression, and Lasso regression methods were employed to construct and validate a hypoxia-related prognostic model. The model's effectiveness was evaluated through its predictive capabilities regarding chemotherapy sensitivity and overall survival. RESULTS: Our research integrated data from scRNA-seq and the TCGA-PAAD database to construct a hypoxia-related prognostic model that encompassed 13 critical genes. This hypoxia model independently predicted chemotherapy response and poor outcomes, outperforming traditional clinicopathologic features. Additionally, a pan-cancer analysis affirmed the relevance of our hypoxia-related genes across multiple malignancies, particularly highlighting KRTCAP2 as a pivotal biomarker associated with worse prognosis and reduced immune infiltration. CONCLUSION: Our findings underscored the prognostic potential of hypoxia-related model and offered a novel avenue for therapeutic targeting, aiming to ameliorate outcomes in pancreatic cancer.\",\n",

       "  'AB': \"BACKGROUND: Pancreatic cancer patients' prognosis may be limited by two conditions, cachexia and sarcopenia. Resistance exercise and protein supplementation are safe non-pharmacological strategies that may increase or preserve skeletal muscle mass within this population. Therefore, the primary aim of this study is to examine the feasibility of a home-based virtually supervised resistance exercise intervention, with or without protein supplementation in pancreatic cancer patients initiating neoadjuvant chemotherapy. This intervention may also maintain skeletal muscle mass and improve plasma biomarkers associated with muscle tissue wasting, physical function and psychological measures. METHODS: We aim to recruit 45 patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer initiating neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Patients will be randomized to receive either Resistance Exercise (RE) (n = 15), Resistance Exercise and Protein Supplementation (RE + PS) (n = 15), or Attention Control (AC) (n = 15). Patients randomized to RE or RE + PS will receive 16-weeks of home-based virtually supervised resistance exercise. The AC will receive a 16-week stretching program. Primary and secondary outcomes will be measured at baseline and after 16 weeks during study visits. DISCUSSION: The REBUILD trial is the first randomized controlled trial that combines resistance exercise with daily protein supplementation during neoadjuvant chemotherapy in pancreatic cancer patients. Our novel home-based virtually supervised exercise intervention seeks to mitigate barriers to participation in this vulnerable population. Furthermore, results of this trial will address important research gaps associated with pancreatic cancer-related cachexia, a condition closely connected with poor prognosis and mortality.\",\n",

       "  'AB': 'Pancreatic cancer remains one for the most aggressive cancer worldwide, with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma being the most common malignant pancreatic lesion, associated with poor prognosis. While surgical resection is the only curative treatment, only a minority of patients is eligible for surgery due to its diagnosis at advanced stages. Therefore, strategies for early detection of pancreatic cancer are needed. This article aims to provide a state-of-the-art review of the most common conditions associated to an increased risk of pancreatic cancer. Conditions linked to risk of pancreatic cancer development include certain pancreato-biliary anatomical variants, intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms, mucinous cystic neoplasm, and familial pancreatic cancer with specific genetic mutations. Early imaging signs of pancreatic cancer can also be incidentally encountered on CT or MRI performed for other indications and they should be promptly recognized by the radiologists in order to avoid delays in the diagnosis. The features include focal pancreatic atrophy, contour deformity, dilation of the main pancreatic duct (MPD), changes in the caliber of the MPD, abrupt interruption of the MPD, and biliary tree dilation. MRI with the adoption of abbreviated protocols has been increasingly evaluated for the follow-up of cystic lesions. Although screening of the general population is not recommended due to the low incidence and high costs, surveillance with MRI can be considered in selected high-risk individuals.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a highly lethal malignancy, ranking seventh among cancer-related deaths worldwide. This study utilizes data from the 2021 Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study to examine the global burden of PC and associated health inequalities from 1990 to 2021, with a focus on key risk factors such as obesity, high fasting plasma glucose, and the Socio-Demographic Index (SDI). METHODS: Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) for PC were estimated using GBD 2021 data. The analysis incorporated SDI, age, gender, and major risk factors, including obesity and high fasting plasma glucose. Descriptive statistics and visualizations, such as age-sex pyramids and geographic maps, were employed to assess global, regional, and national burdens. Health disparities were quantified using the Concentration Index (CI) and the Slope Index of Inequality (SII), with CI assessing relative health distribution by income and SII measuring absolute socioeconomic inequality. RESULTS: Globally, PC-related DALYs rose from 1.76 million in 1990 to 4.25 million in 2021 (141.48% increase), with the age-standardized DALY rate up 11.57% to 48.71 (95% UI 23.43 to 74.33). The burden was highest in high SDI regions, while low SDI areas still faced elevated rates; transitional and developing economies showed the highest age-standardized DALY rates. The SII increased from 189.63 (95% CI 177.65 to 245.17) in 1990 to 321.17 (95% CI 294.48 to 379.722) in 2021, indicating widening socioeconomic disparities. CONCLUSION: PC remains a significant global health challenge with growing socioeconomic and geographic disparities. Urgent action is needed to address modifiable risk factors (e.g., obesity, diabetes) through enhanced healthcare infrastructure, early detection, and treatment access in low SDI countries, alongside improved data systems and international collaboration.',\n",

This study reports a rare case of concurrent AMI and pulmonary thromboembolism in a patient diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. CASE PRESENTATION: A 70-year-old woman presented with acute chest pain and ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, prompting immediate percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with the deployment of a drug-eluting stent. Following PCI, she was treated with optimal medical therapy, including dual antiplatelet therapy. Subsequent investigations revealed pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, and imaging findings suggestive of pancreatic cancer. Anticoagulation therapy was initiated to manage the VTE. Approximately 1 month after PCI, antithrombotic agents were temporarily discontinued for pancreatic mass biopsy, confirming pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. The patient was referred for palliative chemotherapy. DISCUSSION: This case highlights the clinical manifestation of Trousseau's syndrome, characterized by cancer-associated thromboembolism, and underscores the importance of coordinated antithrombotic management in complex clinical settings.\",\n",

       "  'AB': 'INTRODUCTION: Pancreatic cancer metastasis to the cerebellopontine angle (CPA) is extremely rare and often misdiagnosed preoperatively. The clinical characteristics and prognosis of this uncommon condition remain largely unknown. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 68-year-old male who presented with recurrent headaches, dizziness, and gait disturbances. The patient had undergone pancreaticoduodenectomy for pancreatic head adenocarcinoma two years prior. Preoperative imaging suggested a right CPA meningioma. The patient underwent resection of the CPA tumor under general anesthesia. Postoperative pathology revealed a metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Despite treatment with adjuvant chemotherapy, the patient developed widespread metastatic disease and succumbed 2 months after the CPA tumor resection. DISCUSSION: The rarity of pancreatic cancer metastasizing to the CPA presents diagnostic challenges, as evidenced by the initial misdiagnosis of meningioma in this case. The clinical presentation can mimic benign conditions, leading to delays in appropriate management. This case underscores the importance of considering metastatic disease in patients with a history of cancer, even when presenting with symptoms typical of more common CPA lesions. CONCLUSION: Vigilant monitoring is crucial in pancreatic cancer patients, as neurological symptoms may herald metastatic spread to uncommon sites like the CPA. Despite surgical intervention, widespread metastasis can lead to poor outcomes. Early diagnosis and a high index of suspicion are essential for optimal management of these rare cases.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'PURPOSE: Pancreatic cancer poses significant challenges in symptom management. Many people have intractable pain and anorexia which is often not amenable to current available options for palliation. This study aims to outline the longitudinal patterns and assess the burden of distress related to pain and appetite experienced by individuals with pancreatic cancer in people referred to Australian palliative care services. METHODS: Consecutive national cohort study using point-of-care data on symptom distress in people referred to specialist palliative care services. RESULTS: From 2013 to 2022, information from 20,558 care episodes involving 15,536 people with pancreatic cancer referred to 203 palliative care services nationally were included. Similar numbers of people were admitted to inpatient and community services, with 69% and 60% reporting distress due to pain and appetite, respectively. Distress extended to sleeping (79%, 82%), nausea (83%, 85%), bowels (80%, 83%), breathing (70%, 77%) and fatigue (77%, 77%) for pain and appetite, respectively. Strongest associations were with psychological/spiritual issues (inpatient OR 1.78, 95% CI 1.66-1.90) and pain severity (community OR 1.51, 95% CI 1.42-1.60) for appetite-related distress and pain severity (inpatient OR 1.60, 95% CI 1.49-1.72; community OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.27-1.44) for pain distress. Trends within the cohort revealed increased mild appetite-related distress (+ 10%) and decreased moderate (- 22%) and severe (- 11%) distress, with similar trends for pain. CONCLUSION: This study underscores prevalent distress in people with pancreatic cancer in Australian palliative care, highlighting the need for optimised referrals and strategies targeting pain severity, appetite-related concerns and psychological and spiritual aspects for improved care outcomes.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Cancer cachexia is a multifactorial condition characterized by skeletal muscle wasting that impairs quality of life and longevity for many cancer patients. A greater understanding of the molecular etiology of this condition is needed for effective therapies to be developed. We performed a quantitative proteomic analysis of skeletal muscle from cachectic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients and non-cancer controls, followed by immunohistochemical analyses of muscle cross sections. These data provide evidence of a local inflammatory response in muscles of cachectic PDAC patients, including an accumulation of plasma proteins and recruitment of immune cells into muscle that may promote the pathological remodeling of muscle. Our data further support the complement system as a potential mediator of these processes, which we tested by injecting murine pancreatic cancer cells into wild-type mice and mice with genetic deletion of the central complement component 3 (C3-/- mice). Compared with wild-type mice, C3-/- mice showed attenuated tumor-induced muscle wasting and dysfunction and reduced immune cell recruitment and fibrotic remodeling of muscle. These studies demonstrate that complement activation contributes to the skeletal muscle pathology and dysfunction in PDAC, suggesting that the complement system may possess therapeutic potential in preserving skeletal muscle mass and function.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is predominantly driven by mutations in the Kirsten rat sarcoma virus (KRAS) oncogene. Due to the pivotal role of KRAS in PDAC pathogenesis, KRAS inhibitors (KRASi) have recently demonstrated initial signs of clinical efficacy. However, considering currently documented response rates and the resistance development to KRASi, additional targeted therapies are needed. In this context, we provide a summary of recent preclinical and clinical findings on protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) inhibitors (PRMT5i) and their implications for PDAC. PRMT5 has been linked to key oncogenic processes, including epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), MYC and Hippo signaling pathways, glycolysis, and therapy resistance. With further advancements and optimization of PRMT5i-based therapies, these inhibitors hold significant potential as therapeutic agents for PDAC treatment. Therefore, we synthesize the current understanding of PRMT5i and highlight promising directions for future developments in PDAC.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Obesity and diabetes are positively associated with pancreatic cancer risk. It is unclear, however, whether fat or fat-free mass plays a role in these relationships, whether abdominal obesity is more important than general obesity or whether the associations with anthropometric indices and diabetes are independent of each other. METHODS: We used multivariable Cox proportional hazards models to examine the prospective associations of body composition (allometric fat-mass index (AFI) and allometric lean-mass index (ALI), based on bioelectrical impedance, uncorrelated with each other and with height), waist size (allometric waist-to-hip index (WHI), uncorrelated with weight and height) and diabetes with pancreatic cancer risk in UK Biobank. We tested heterogeneity by sex, age and follow-up time with the augmentation method (p_het). RESULTS: During a mean follow-up of 10.4 years, 999 pancreatic cancer cases were ascertained in 427,939 participants. AFI was positively associated with pancreatic cancer risk in participants overall, independent of ALI, WHI, diabetes and covariates (hazard ratio HR = 1.102; 95% confidence interval CI = 1.033-1.176 per 1 standard deviation (SD) increase), more strongly in women aged under 55 years at recruitment (HR = 1.457; 95% CI = 1.181-1.797; p_het = 0.007) and in men only for follow-up 6 years or longer (HR = 1.159; 95% CI = 1.037-1.295; p_het = 0.075). ALI was positively associated with pancreatic cancer risk in participants overall (HR = 1.072; 95% CI = 1.005-1.145), more specifically in men (HR = 1.132; 95% CI = 1.035-1.238; p_het = 0.091). A positive association of WHI with pancreatic cancer risk was observed only in unadjusted models but was lost after adjustment for smoking status and diabetes. Independent of anthropometric indices, diabetes was associated positively with pancreatic cancer risk in participants overall (HR = 1.688; 95% CI = 1.365-2.087), but in women only for follow-up under 6 years (HR = 2.467; 95% CI = 1.477-4.121; p_het = 0.042). CONCLUSIONS: General obesity (reflected in AFI and ALI) and diabetes but not abdominal obesity were associated positively with pancreatic cancer risk, independent of each other and covariates.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: CXCR1/2 inhibitors are being implemented with immunotherapies in PDAC clinical trials. CXC-ligands are a family of cytokines responsible for stimulating these receptors; while typically secreted by activated immune cells, fibroblasts, and even adipocytes, they are also secreted by immune-evasive cancer cells. CXC-ligand release is known to occur in response to inflammatory stimuli. Adipose tissue is an endocrine organ and a source of inflammatory signaling peptides. Importantly, adipose-derived cytokines and chemokines are implicated as potential drivers of tumor cell immune evasion; cumulatively, these findings suggest that targeting CXC-ligands may be beneficial in the context of obesity. METHODS: RNA-sequencing of human PDAC cell lines was used to assess influences of adipose conditioned media on the cancer cell transcriptome. The adipose-induced secretome of PDAC cells was validated with ELISA for induction of CXCL5 secretion. Human tissue data from CPTAC was used to correlate IL-1beta and TNF expression with both CXCL5 mRNA and protein levels. CRISPR-Cas9 was used to knockout CXCL5 from a murine PDAC KPC cell line to assess orthotopic tumor studies in syngeneic, diet-induced obese mice. Flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry were used to compare the immune profiles between tumors with or without CXCL5. Mice-bearing CXCL5 competent or deficient tumors were monitored for differential tumor size in response to anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint blockade therapy. RESULTS: Human adipose tissue conditioned media stimulates CXCL5 secretion from PDAC cells via either IL-1beta or TNF; neutralization of both is required to significantly block the release of CXCL5 from tumor cells. Ablation of CXCL5 from tumors promoted an enriched immune phenotype with an unanticipatedly increased number of exhausted CD8 T cells. Application of anti-PD-1 treatment to control tumors failed to alter tumor growth, yet treatment of CXCL5-deficient tumors showed response by significantly diminished tumor mass. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, our findings show that both TNF and IL-1beta can stimulate CXCL5 release from PDAC cells in vitro, which correlates with expression in patient data. CXCL5 depletion in vivo alone is sufficient to promote T cell infiltration into tumors, increasing efficacy and requiring checkpoint blockade inhibition to alleviate tumor burden.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'PURPOSE: The aim of the study is to demonstrate the prognostic impact of preoperative nutritional status indicators, including prognostic nutritional index (PNI), hemoglobin-albumin-lymphocyte-platelet (HALP) score, sarcopenia index (SI), and bone mineral density (BMD) values, on postoperative complications and survival in patients with resectable pancreatic cancer (PC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The medical data and computed tomography (CT) images of 85 patients who undergone surgery for PC between January 2017 and 2023 were evaluated retrospectively. Patients were grouped according to the presence or absence of sarcopenia and osteoporosis, high and low PNI and HALP scores. The groups were compared in terms of the complication development rate, 30- and 90-day mortality, and 5-years overall survival (OS). Sarcopenia and osteoporosis were determined from CT images (sarcopenia index used for sarcopenia, bone mineral density for osteoporosis). RESULTS: Except from OS (p < 0.0001), no differences were found between sarcopenic and non-sarcopenic groups in terms of postoperative complications, 30- and 90-day mortality (p = 0.775, p = 0.704, p = 0.196, respectively). There were no differences between the groups with and without osteoporosis in terms of the presence of postoperative complications, 30- and 90-day mortality, and OS (p = 0.770, p = 0.608, p = 0.196, p = 0.09, respectively) as low and high HALP score groups (p = 0.236, p = 0.696, p = 0.299, p = 0.45, respectively). Except from a 30-day mortality (p = 0.03), no differences were found between low and high PNI groups in terms of postoperative complications, 90-day mortality, and OS (p = 0.82, p = 0.09, p = 0.18, respectively). CONCLUSION: PNI may be used as prognostic data for early postoperative mortality, while sarcopenia may be indicative of 5-year OS in patients with resectable PC. Our results suggest that providing nutritional support may potentially improve prognosis. Future studies, in which other factors effective in prognosis are evaluated together with nutritional status, will show more information on this subject.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'This editorial is a commentary on the case report by Furuya et al focusing on the challenging diagnosis of early pancreatic adenocarcinoma and new tools for an earlier diagnosis. Currently, pancreatic cancer still has a poor prognosis, mainly due to late diagnosis in an advanced stage. Two main precancerous routes have been identified as pathways to pancreatic adenocarcinoma: The first encompasses a large group of mucinous cystic lesions: intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm and mucinous cystic neoplasm, and the second is pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia. In the last decade the focus of research has been to identify high-risk patients, using advanced imaging techniques (magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography or endoscopic ultrasonography) which could be helpful in finding \"indirect signs\" of early stage pancreatic lesions. Nevertheless, the survival rate still remains poor, and alternative screening methods are under investigation. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography followed by serial pancreatic juice aspiration cytology could be a promising tool for identifying precursor lesions such as intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm, but confirming data are still needed to validate its role. Probably a combination of cross-sectional imaging, endoscopic techniques (old and new ones) and genetic and biological biomarkers (also in pancreatic juice) could be the best solution to reach an early diagnosis. Biomarkers could help to predict and follow the progression of early pancreatic lesions. However, further studies are needed to validate their diagnostic reliability and to establish diagnostic algorithms to improve prognosis and survival in patients with pancreatic cancer.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Groove pancreatitis is a rare complication of chronic pancreatitis that can lead to severe manifestations, including gastric outlet obstruction. A 37-year-old man with a history of chronic alcohol use presented with recurrent epigastric pain radiating to the back, accompanied by nausea and vomiting. Imaging revealed features of chronic pancreatitis such as pancreatic calcifications, pseudocyst formation, and a mass-like lesion in the pancreatic head causing duodenal stenosis. Despite medical management and endoscopic interventions like biliary and duodenal stenting, the patient experienced persistent symptoms due to complications such as stent migration and failure to relieve the obstruction. Nutritional support became essential because of malnutrition from exocrine insufficiency and the inability to tolerate oral intake. Differentiating between groove pancreatitis and pancreatic carcinoma was challenging, as imaging and clinical features overlapped, and repeated fine-needle aspirations were non-diagnostic. Ultimately, due to near-complete duodenal obstruction unresponsive to endoscopic treatment, the patient underwent an open gastrojejunostomy. Postoperatively, he demonstrated significant improvement, with the resumption of oral intake and stabilization of his nutritional status. Management required a multidisciplinary approach, combining medical therapy, surgical intervention, nutritional support, and addressing alcohol dependence to prevent further pancreatic damage. Early recognition and appropriate treatment of groove pancreatitis and its complications are essential to improve outcomes and prevent disease progression.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'PURPOSE: Pancreatic cancer remains a deadly disease with a low survival rate specifically if diagnosed at later stages. Surgery is one of the mainstay treatments for early stage disease but is accompanied by significant mortality and morbidity even in high volume centers. In the present study we wanted to determine the influence of pre-operative weight loss, BMI and liver function tests on postoperative outcomes. METHODS: Data for patients who underwent pancreatic surgery at the American University of Beirut Medical Center between 1998 and 2017 were analyzed. The data included patient demographics, pathologic diagnosis, stage, nodal involvement, tumor grade, surgical margin, type of adjuvant therapy, liver function tests and post-operative complications. The correlation and p-value were determined by the chi-square test with p-value < 0.05 considered statistically significant. RESULTS: The analysis included 236 patients. 63% were males and mean age was 60 years. A total of 96 (41%) patients had significant weight loss prior to surgery and 173 (31%) had a BMI > 30 kg/m2 which were considered obese. Obesity and significant weight loss were associated with increased risk of post-operative complications (P = 0.013 and P = 0.004, respectively). Transaminases and cholestatic liver enzymes were not associated with post-operative complications. CONCLUSIONS: Assessment and management of nutritional status particularly weight loss and BMI prior to pancreatic cancer surgery may influence postoperative outcomes in this patient population.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Low skeletal muscle mass and impaired muscle quality (myosteatosis) have been associated with poor outcomes in cancer patients. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of pre-therapeutic low muscle mass and myosteatosis on chemoradiotherapy (CRT)-induced toxicity and survival outcomes in patients with non-resectable pancreatic cancer (PC). METHODS: In this retrospective study, pre-therapeutic CT scans were used to measure muscle mass/density. Low muscle mass was defined as a skeletal muscle index <38.5 cm(2)/m(2) (women) and <52.4 cm(2)/m(2) (men), and myosteatosis as a mean psoas density <41 HU if BMI < 25 kg/m(2) or <33 HU if BMI > 25 kg/m(2). Adverse effects were collected per week (W) of treatment. Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was defined as any toxicity leading to dose reduction, treatment delays or permanent discontinuation. RESULTS: Among the 85 included patients, 75 (88.2%) and 18 (22.2%) had pre-therapeutic low muscle mass and myosteatosis, respectively. Only 12 patients (14.1%) experienced DLT. Patients with low muscle mass developed significantly more toxicities at W2 (p = 0.013) and W5 (p = 0.026), notably more nausea (p = 0.037) and anemia (p = 0.004). Low muscle mass was associated with poorer overall survival (HR 4.41 [1.50-12.94], p = 0.007) in multivariate Cox analysis, while myosteatosis was not associated with CRT toxicities, DLT and overall survival (p = 0.408). CONCLUSION: Patients with low muscle mass experienced more toxicities and poorer outcomes during CRT for non-resectable PC.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Among cancer patients, pancreatic cancer patients have the highest rate of sarcopenia, which is a critical prognostic factor. Serum creatine kinase (CK) is closely related to skeletal muscle mass and has been reported to decline with the progression of cancer. This study investigated whether preoperative serum CK is associated with the survival of patients with pancreatic cancer. METHODS: Data were obtained from patients with pathologically confirmed pancreatic cancer between June 2016 and March 2022. The prognostic significance of CK was analyzed based on sex-stratified groups. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to compare overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were used to determine prognostic factors. Body composition was analyzed based on preoperative abdominal CT images to explore the sex-specific associations between skeletal muscle area (SMA) and serum CK levels. RESULTS: A total of 166 patients were included in this study. Sarcopenia was presented in 70 patients (42.2%). A low serum CK level showed a significant correlation with the diagnosis of sarcopenia in male patients (P = 0.026). The levels of CK did not predict the outcome in female patients, while a low preoperative CK was notably linked to shorter OS in male patients (median OS: 15 months vs. 33 months, P = 0.011; median DFS: 5 months vs. 14 months, P = 0.007). Multivariate analyses further confirmed the effect of CK in predicting OS (CK>44 IU/L, HR:0.226, 95% CI:0.107-0.478, P < 0.001) and DFS (CK>44 IU/L, HR:0.272, 95% CI:0.139-0.529, P < 0.001) of male patients. Correlation analysis revealed a significant association between SMA and CK levels in male patients (r = 0.225, P = 0.025), and such a correlation was not observed in female patients (r = 0.088, P = 0.478). CONCLUSION: The pretherapeutic CK may represent a simple marker for predicting poor survival in male patients with resectable pancreatic cancer, thereby aiding in the selection of therapeutic strategies.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Cancer cachexia represents a debilitating muscle wasting condition that is highly prevalent in gastrointestinal cancers, including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Cachexia is estimated to contribute to ~30% of cancer-related deaths, with deterioration of respiratory muscles suspected to be a key contributor to cachexia-associated morbidity and mortality. In recent studies, we identified fibrotic remodelling of respiratory accessory muscles as a key feature of human PDAC cachexia. METHODS: To gain insight into mechanisms driving respiratory muscle wasting and fibrotic remodelling in response to PDAC, we conducted temporal histological and transcriptomic analyses on diaphragm muscles harvested from mice-bearing orthotopic murine pancreatic (KPC) tumours at time points reflective of precachexia (D8 and D10), mild-moderate cachexia (D12 and D14) and advanced cachexia (endpoint). RESULTS: During the precachexia phase, diaphragms showed significant leukocyte infiltration (+3-fold to +13-fold; D8-endpoint vs. Sham, p < 0.05) and transcriptomic enrichment of inflammatory processes associated with tissue injury that remained increased through endpoint. Diaphragm inflammation was followed by increases in PDGFR-a(+) fibroadipogenic progenitors (+2.5 to +3.8-fold; D10-endpoint vs. Sham, p < 0.05), fibre atrophy (-16% to -24%, D12 to endpoint vs. Sham, p < 0.05), ECM expansion (+1.5 to +1.8-fold; D14-endpoint vs. Sham, p < 0.05), collagen accumulation (+3.8-fold; endpoint vs. Sham, p = 0.0013) and reductions in breathing frequency (-55%, p = 0.0074) and diaphragm excursion (-43%, p = 0.0006). These biological processes were supported by changes in the diaphragm transcriptome. Ingenuity pathway analysis predicted factors involved in inflammatory responses to tissue injury, including TGF-beta1, angiotensin and PDGF BB, as top upstream regulators activated in diaphragms prior to and throughout cachexia progression, while PGC-1alpha and the insulin receptor were among the top upstream regulators predicted to be suppressed. The transcriptomic dataset further revealed progressive disturbances to networks involved in lipid, glucose and oxidative metabolism, activation of the unfolded protein response and neuromuscular junction remodelling associated with denervation. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, our data support leukocyte infiltration and expansion of PDGFRalpha mesenchymal progenitors as early events that precede wasting and fibrotic remodelling of the diaphragm in response to PDAC that may also underlie metabolic disturbances, weakness and respiratory complications.',\n",

       "  'AB': \"BACKGROUND: Adjuvant chemotherapy can promote the 5-year overall survival rate of pancreatic cancer (PC) patients to 16%-21%. However, the negative emotions of patients, such as anxiety, are usually omitted. Moreover, their disease burden concentrates on pain symptoms, seriously affecting the quality of life of patients. How to improve the negative emotions of PC patients, alleviate their pain, and ameliorate their quality of life has become an urgent issue. OBJECTIVE: To explore the effect of mindfulness meditation (MM) combined with the BrainLink intelligent biofeedback instrument on the anxiety, pain, brain fatigue, and quality of life of PC patients under chemotherapy. METHOD: A total of 145 PC patients under chemotherapy were admitted to the Department of Hepatobiliary Surgery of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Army Military Medical University from January 2022 to March 2024 and were incorporated as study objects. They were divided into a control group (n = 72) and a test group (n = 73) according to the random number table. The control group received routine nursing treatment; the experimental group was treated with MM combined with an intelligent biofeedback instrument. The general information, anxiety (SAS), pain (VAS), EEG signal data (degrees of fatigue, concentration, and relaxation and EEG waves), and quality of life (EORTC QLQ-C30) of the two groups before intervention and 4th, 8th, and 12th weeks after intervention were compared. RESULT: There is no significant difference in baseline data and pathological features between the two groups. After the 4th, 8th, and 12th weeks of intervention, the SAS values of the experimental group are remarkably lower than those of the control group (p < 0.05). In the 4th, 8th, and 12th weeks of intervention, the VAS scores of the experimental group are apparently lower than those of the control group (p < 0.05). In the 4th, 8th, and 12th weeks of intervention, the score of the quality of life (EORTC QLQ-C30) in the experimental group is significantly higher than that in the control group (p < 0.05). In the 4th, 8th, and 12th weeks, compared with the control group, the experimental group patients showed significant improvement in brain fatigue relief, concentration, and relaxation levels (p < 0.05), while the experimental group's brain alpha and theta. The wave showed an upward trend (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: MM combined with the BrainLink intelligent biofeedback instrument can significantly mitigate the anxiety, pain severity, and brain fatigue relief degree of PC patients under chemotherapy, thereby promoting their quality of life. It provides a novel intervention for the psychosomatic health of PC patients under chemotherapy.\",\n",

       "  'AB': 'Pancreatic cancer (PC), a highly lethal tumor with nearly identical incidence and mortality rates, has become the sixth leading cause of cancer-related deaths. Hypoxia is an important malignant factor in PC, as it regulates angiogenesis, metabolic reprogramming, tumor progression, and metastasis. Disrupting the hypoxic microenvironment can enhance the efficacy of antitumor therapy and improve the prognosis of patients with PC. With the advent of bioinformatics, hypoxia-related PC models have emerged in recent years. They provide a reference for estimating the prognosis and immune microenvironment of patients with PC and identify potential biomarkers for targeting hypoxic microenvironment. However, these findings based on bioinformatic analysis may not be completely reliable without further experimental evidence and clinical cohort validation. The application of these models and biomarkers in clinical practice to predict survival time and develop anti hypoxic therapeutic strategies for patients with PC remains in its infancy. In this editorial, we review the current status of hypoxia-related prognostic models in PC, analyze their similarities and differences, discuss several existing challenges, and provide potential solutions and directions for further studies. This editorial will facilitate the optimization, validation, and determination of the molecular mechanisms of related models.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Cancer cachexia affects up to 80% of patients with cancer and results in reduced quality of life and survival. We previously demonstrated that the transcriptional repressor Forkhead box P1 (FoxP1) is upregulated in the skeletal muscle of cachectic mice and people with cancer, and when overexpressed in skeletal muscle, it is sufficient to induce pathological features characteristic of cachexia. However, the role of myofiber-derived FoxP1 in both normal muscle physiology and cancer-induced muscle wasting remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we generated a conditional mouse line with myofiber-specific ablation of FoxP1 (FoxP1(SkmKO)) and found that in cancer-free mice, deletion of FoxP1 in skeletal myofibers resulted in increased myofiber size in both males and females, with a significant increase in muscle mass in males. In response to murine KPC pancreatic tumor burden, we found that myofiber-derived FoxP1 mediates cancer-induced muscle wasting and diaphragm muscle weakness in male but not female mice. In summary, our findings identify myofiber-specific FoxP1 as a negative regulator of skeletal muscle with sex-specific differences in the context of cancer.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Here we identify myofiber-derived FoxP1 as a negative regulator of skeletal muscle with sex-specific effects in cancer. Under cancer-free conditions, FoxP1 knockout increased myofiber size in male and female mice. However, in response to pancreatic cancer, FoxP1 myofiber-specific deletion attenuated muscle wasting and weakness in males but not females. This highlights the need to consider sexual dimorphism in cancer-induced muscle pathologies and provides evidence suggesting that targeting FoxP1 could help mitigate these effects in males.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'OBJECTIVES: Pancreatic cancer presents a formidable challenge with its aggressive nature and dismal prognosis, often hampered by elusive early symptoms. The tumor microenvironment (TME) emerges as a pivotal player in pancreatic cancer progression and treatment responses, characterized notably by hypoxia and immunosuppression. In this study, we aimed to identify hypoxia-related genes and develop a prognostic model for pancreatic cancer leveraging these genes. METHODS: Through analysis of gene expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and subsequent GO/KEGG enrichment analysis, hypoxia-related pathways were identified. We constructed a prognostic model using lasso regression and validated it using an independent dataset. RESULTS: Our results showed that expression levels of PLAU, SLC2A1, and CA9 exhibited significant associations with prognosis in pancreatic cancer. The prognostic model, built upon these genes, displayed robust predictive accuracy and was validated in an independent dataset. Furthermore, we found a correlation between the risk score of the prognostic model and clinical parameters of pancreatic cancer patients. At the same time, we also explored the relationship between the established hypoxia-related prognostic model and the immune microenvironment at the single-cell level. RT-qPCR results showed notable differences in the expression of hypoxia pathway-related genes between normal PANC-1 and hypoxic-treated PANC-1 cells. CONCLUSION: Our study provides insights into the role of the hypoxic microenvironment in pancreatic cancer and offers a promising prognostic tool for clinical application.',\n",

Cachectic PDAC KIC mice exhibit severe sarcopenia with loss of muscle mass and strength associated with reduced muscle fiber's size and induction of protein degradation processes. Mitochondria in PDAC atrophied muscles show reduced respiratory capacities and structural alterations, associated with deregulation of oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial dynamics pathways. Beyond the metabolic pathways known to be altered in sarcopenic muscle (carbohydrates, proteins, and redox), lipid and nucleic acid metabolisms are also affected. Although the number of mitochondria per cell is not altered, mitochondrial mass shows a twofold decrease and the mitochondrial DNA threefold, suggesting a defect in mitochondrial genome homeostasis. In conclusion, this work provides a framework to guide toward the most relevant targets in the clinic to limit PDAC-induced cachexia.\",\n",

       "  'AB': \"This comprehensive literature review is to summarize the most recent findings regarding the causes, diagnosis, and treatments of pancreatic cancer and to encourage additional investigation into this under-researched malignant tumor. Pancreatic cancer is a significant public health issue in China, with annual mortality rates almost equal to incidence rates. The disease is more prevalent in rural areas and has a poor prognosis. The data was collected from the following databases: Pub Med, Cross ref, Science Direct, Scopus, and Google Scholar we reviewed published articles from 2018 to 2023 on the annual incidence of pancreatic cancer in China is 5.1%, with only 5-7% of patients completely cured. The prognosis is extremely poor, with a 1-year survival rate of 8% and a 5-year survival rate of 3%. Pancreatic cancer has no specific clinical manifestations or tumor markers, and its characteristics are not typical of high-risk factors including smoking, alcohol, chronic pancreatitis, abnormal microorganism metabolism, blood type, and glucose and lipid levels. For increased detection and survival rates, pancreatic cancer must be diagnosed as early as possible. However, the low specificity of tumor markers calls for more study. Future treatment strategies could include immunotherapy and a microbiology-free system, and it's anticipated that they'll offer intriguing clinical applications for extending patients' lives with pancreatic cancer. Finally, we suggest measures to improve the health outcomes of pancreatic cancer patients in China.\",\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a significant cause of cancer-related mortality, with limited curative options and high rates of cachexia, a debilitating syndrome associated with poor prognosis. While previous research has linked sarcopenia to poor outcomes in PC, the correlation between cachexia and treatment outcomes remains underexplored. This meta-analysis aims to investigate the association between cachexia and overall survival and time to treatment failure in advanced PC patients undergoing first-line chemotherapy. METHOD: A systematic search of electronic databases was conducted following PRISMA guidelines. Eligible studies compared cachexic and non-cachexic PC patients, reporting outcomes of observed survival or time to treatment failure. Data extraction and analysis were performed using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis Version 3.3, employing random-effects models and sensitivity analyses to assess heterogeneity and bias. RESULTS: Seven observational studies involving 2834 PC patients were included. The incidence of cachexia was 45% (95% CI: 0.27-0.65), with a higher prevalence in East Asian populations. Cachexic patients experienced significantly earlier treatment failure (SDM: -2.22, 95% CI: -2.6 to -1.7, P = 0.0001) and higher mortality risk (HR: 2.02, 95% CI: 1.17-3.48, P = 0.011) compared to non-cachexic patients. Overall survival was lower in cachexic patients (SDM: -2.34, 95% CI: -3.7 to -0.90, P = 0.001), with considerable heterogeneity across studies. Meta-regression analysis revealed significant differences between countries but insignificant correlations with age. CONCLUSION: Cachexia is associated with reduced overall survival, early chemotherapy failure, and elevated mortality in advanced PC patients undergoing first-line chemotherapy. Recognition and management of cachexia are crucial for optimizing treatment outcomes and improving patient survival. Future research should focus on prospective studies to better understand the impact of cachexia on treatment response and develop tailored interventions to mitigate its adverse effects.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: The prognosis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDAC) remains very poor, emphasizing the critical importance of early detection, where biomarkers offer unique potential. Although growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) and Lipocalin 2 (LCN2) have been linked to PDAC, their precise roles as biomarkers are uncertain. METHODS: Circulating levels of GDF15 and LCN2 were examined in human PDAC patients, heathy controls, and individuals with benign pancreatic diseases. Circulating levels of IL-6, CA19-9, and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) were measured for comparisons. Correlations between PDAC progression and overall survival were assessed. A mouse PDAC model was employed for comprehensive analyses, complementing the human studies by exploring associations with various metabolic and inflammatory parameters. Sensitivity and specificity of the biomarkers were evaluated. FINDINGS: Our results demonstrated elevated levels of circulating GDF15 and LCN2 in PDAC patients compared to both healthy controls and individuals with benign pancreatic diseases, with higher GDF15 levels associated with disease progression and increased mortality. In PDAC mice, circulating GDF15 and LCN2 progressively increased, correlating with tumor growth, behavioral manifestations, tissue and molecular pathology, and cachexia development. GDF15 exhibited highly sensitive and specific for PDAC patients compared to CA19-9, IL-6, or NLR, while LCN2 showed even greater sensitivity and specificity in PDAC mice. Combining GDF15 and LCN2, or GDF15 and CA19-9, enhanced sensitivity and specificity. INTERPRETATION: Our findings indicate that GDF15 holds promise as a biomarker for early detection and prognosis of PDAC, while LCN2 could strengthen diagnostic panels.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a dismal disease with a low 5-year survival rate of only 13%. Despite intense research efforts, PDAC remains insufficiently understood. In part, this is attributed to opposing effects of key players being unraveled, including the stroma but also molecules that act in a context-dependent manner. One such molecule is the transcription factor C/EBPdelta, where we recently showed that C/EBPdelta exerts tumor-suppressive effects in PDAC cells in vitro. To better understand the role of C/EBPdelta in different contexts and the development of PDAC, we here build on these findings and assess the effect of C/EBPdelta in a PDAC model in mice. We establish that the lack of oxygen in vivo-hypoxia-counteracts the tumor-suppressive effects of C/EBPdelta, and identify a reciprocal feedback loop between C/EBPdelta and HIF-1alpha. RNA sequencing of C/EBPdelta-induced cells under hypoxia also suggests that the growth-limiting effects of C/EBPdelta decrease with oxygen tension. Consequently, in vitro proliferation assays reveal that the tumor-suppressive activities of C/EBPdelta are abrogated due to hypoxia. This study demonstrates the importance of considering major physiological parameters in preclinical approaches.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'INTRODUCTION: Early detection of pancreatic cancer continues to be a challenge due to the difficulty in accurately identifying specific signs or symptoms that might correlate with the onset of pancreatic cancer. Unlike breast or colon or prostate cancer where screening tests are often useful in identifying cancerous development, there are no tests to diagnose pancreatic cancers. As a result, most pancreatic cancers are diagnosed at an advanced stage, where treatment options, whether systemic therapy, radiation, or surgical interventions, offer limited efficacy. METHODS: A two-stage weakly supervised deep learning-based model has been proposed to identify pancreatic tumors using computed tomography (CT) images from Henry Ford Health (HFH) and publicly available Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) data sets. In the first stage, the nnU-Net supervised segmentation model was used to crop an area in the location of the pancreas, which was trained on the MSKCC repository of 281 patient image sets with established pancreatic tumors. In the second stage, a multi-instance learning-based weakly supervised classification model was applied on the cropped pancreas region to segregate pancreatic tumors from normal appearing pancreas. The model was trained, tested, and validated on images obtained from an HFH repository with 463 cases and 2,882 controls. RESULTS: The proposed deep learning model, the two-stage architecture, offers an accuracy of 0.907   +/-   0.01, sensitivity of 0.905   +/-   0.01, specificity of 0.908   +/-   0.02, and AUC (ROC) 0.903   +/-   0.01. The two-stage framework can automatically differentiate pancreatic tumor from non-tumor pancreas with improved accuracy on the HFH dataset. DISCUSSION: The proposed two-stage deep learning architecture shows significantly enhanced performance for predicting the presence of a tumor in the pancreas using CT images compared with other reported studies in the literature.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Despite advances in treatment, pancreatic cancer frequently has a low survival rate due to its advanced-stage diagnosis. Treatment focuses on prolonging survival and maintaining quality of life. This study investigates the characteristics associated with survival in advanced pancreatic cancer patients treated at a single academic cancer center in Najran, Saudi Arabia. METHOD: A retrospective chart review study covering the period January 1, 2015, and December 31, 2023, involved 80 adult patients with pathologically confirmed pancreatic cancer (ductal adenocarcinoma) at King Khalid Hospital in Najran, Saudi Arabia. Clinicopathological characteristics, therapy, response, and survival outcomes were all gathered and analyzed. The chi-squared test, Kaplan-Meier, and Cox proportional hazards method with hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used for statistical analysis. RESULT: The mean age was 65.7+/-14.1 years and 54 (67.5%) cases were male. The main symptom was abdominal pain (n=54, 67.5%), while jaundice was presented in 17 (21.2%) of cases. The baseline serum carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9) level varied among cases, with 35 (43.8%) having normal levels. The majority of cases (n=59, 73.8%) had distant metastases at the initial presentation, while 12 cases (15%) had localized disease (resectable), and 22 (27.5%) were locally advanced at the first presentation. The most commonly reported pathologic grade was poorly differentiated ductal adenocarcinoma in 39 (48.8%). FOLFIRINOX was used as first-line chemotherapy in 54 (67.5%) cases, while gemcitabine alone was used in 15 (18.8%) cases. First-line chemotherapy resulted in progressive disease in 30 (37.5%), stable disease in 30 (37.5%), and partial response in 14 (17.5%). With a mean follow-up time of 14.8+/-8.6 months, 57 (71.2%) were dead, where the main cause of death was disease progression (n=51, 89.5%). The median overall survival was 13.5 months, with a 12-month survival rate of 56% and a 36-month survival rate of 17%. The median cancer-specific survival was 16 months (95% CI: 13-22 months). The 12-month median cancer-specific survival was 61% (95% CI: 51-73%), and the 36-month median cancer-specific survival was 19% (95% CI: 10-34%). In univariate analysis, initial metastasis presentation (HR: 35.46; 95% CI: 4.90-256.83, p<0.001), poor Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG-PS) (3-4) (HR: 2.34; 95% CI:1.34-4.09, p=0.003), and presence of multiple metastases (HR: 1.33; 95% CI: 1.09-1.62, p=0.004) were associated with worsened survival. Patients who received the first chemotherapy were associated with better survival (HR: 0.53; 95% CI: 0.29-0.98, p=0.043). Furthermore, the response rate in patients who received FOLFIRINOX was better than that of those who received gemcitabine alone, which was statistically significant (p=0.002). CONCLUSION: Our study showed that initial metastatic presentation, poor ECOG-PS, and the occurrence of numerous metastases were all linked with poor survival of patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Additionally, FOLFIRINOX as a first-line treatment showed better survival rates than gemcitabine alone. Raising awareness among healthcare providers on the alarming signs of pancreatic cancer and the introduction of personalized oncology might improve the outcome of this fatal malignancy.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Cancer-associated cachexia is a multifactorial wasting disorder characterized by anorexia, unintentional weight loss (skeletal muscle mass with or without loss of fat mass), progressive functional impairment, and poor prognosis. This systematic literature review (SLR) examined the relationship between cachexia and survival in patients with colorectal or pancreatic cancer in recent literature. The SLR was conducted following PRISMA guidelines. Embase((R)) and PubMed were searched to identify articles published in English between 1 January 2016 and 10 October 2021 reporting survival in adults with cancer and cachexia or at risk of cachexia, defined by international consensus (IC) diagnostic criteria or a broader definition of any weight loss. Included publications were studies in >/=100 patients with colorectal or pancreatic cancer. Thirteen publications in patients with colorectal cancer and 13 with pancreatic cancer met eligibility criteria. Included studies were observational and primarily from Europe and the United States. Eleven studies (42%) reported cachexia using IC criteria and 15 (58%) reported any weight loss. An association between survival and cachexia or weight loss was assessed across studies using multivariate (n = 23) or univariate (n = 3) analyses and within each study across multiple weight loss categories. Cachexia/weight loss was associated with a statistically significantly poorer survival in at least one weight loss category in 16 of 23 studies that used multivariate analyses and in 1 of 3 studies (33%) that used univariate analyses. Of the 17 studies demonstrating a significant association, 9 were in patients with colorectal cancer and 8 were in patients with pancreatic cancer. Cachexia or weight loss was associated with significantly poorer survival in patients with colorectal or pancreatic cancer in nearly two-thirds of the studies. The classification of weight loss varied across and within studies (multiple categories were evaluated) and may have contributed to variability. Nonetheless, awareness of cachexia and routine assessment of weight change in clinical practice in patients with colorectal or pancreatic cancer could help inform prognosis and influence early disease management strategies.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Pancreatic adenocarcinoma, a clinically challenging malignancy constitutes a significant contributor to cancer-related mortality, characterized by an inherently poor prognosis. This review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of pancreatic adenocarcinoma by examining its multifaceted etiologies, including genetic mutations and environmental factors. The review explains the complex molecular mechanisms underlying its pathogenesis and summarizes current therapeutic strategies, including surgery, chemotherapy, and emerging modalities such as immunotherapy. Critical molecular pathways driving pancreatic cancer development, including KRAS, Notch, and Hedgehog, are discussed. Current therapeutic strategies, including surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation, are discussed, with an emphasis on their limitations, particularly in terms of postoperative relapse. Promising research areas, including liquid biopsies, personalized medicine, and gene editing, are explored, demonstrating the significant potential for enhancing diagnosis and treatment. While immunotherapy presents promising prospects, it faces challenges related to immune evasion mechanisms. Emerging research directions, encompassing liquid biopsies, personalized medicine, CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing, and computational intelligence applications, hold promise for refining diagnostic approaches and therapeutic interventions.

       "  'AB': 'An adult male cadaver, approximately 60 years of age, was dissected as part of an eight-week didactic course. It was found that the subject had evidence of pancreatic cancer with signs of metastasis as well as significant bilateral pulmonary artery clotting. In particular, a saddle embolism was observed, and the cause of death was listed as sudden pulmonary failure. Malignant tumors are often accompanied by hypercoagulable states and increased risk of thromboembolism. Because the clots showed lines of Zahn on histology, we can infer that this hypercoagulable state preceded death and may have been related to the presence of pancreatic carcinoma. There are few recorded cases of pulmonary saddle embolism being the fatal event in cases of underlying pancreatic cancer. The extensive clotting observed in the inferior vena cava and pulmonary arteries demonstrates to clinicians that patients, especially those with pancreatic cancer, are at higher risk for thromboembolic events. This case report also serves as a reminder that instances of pulmonary failure or sudden death because of pulmonary saddle embolism may be caused by underlying visceral neoplasms, such as pancreatic cancer.',\n",

       "  'AB': \"BACKGROUND: Pancreatic cancer is a devastating disease with a poor prognosis, causing significant physical and psychological distress that detrimentally impacts patients' quality of life. AIM: This study aimed to comprehensively assess the physical and psychological status of newly diagnosed pancreatic cancer patients. METHODS: A cohort of 138 newly diagnosed patients completed standardized assessments, including the Edmonton Symptom Assessment System (ESAS), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and Distress Thermometer (DT). Data were analysed using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: The ESAS scores revealed high symptom burden, with mean scores of 6.8 for pain, 7.2 for fatigue, and 4.9 for depression. Measures of well-being indicated low scores, with means of 2.3 for physical well-being, 1.5 for social/family well-being, and 1.7 for emotional well-being. Distress levels were also high, with a mean score of 7.6 on the DT. CONCLUSION: Newly diagnosed pancreatic cancer patients experience substantial physical and psychological challenges, including severe symptom burden, distress, depressive symptoms, and cognitive impairment. Holistic care approaches that prioritize symptom management and address psychological distress are essential to improve patient outcomes and enhance overall well-being.\",\n",

       "  'AB': 'The early detection of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is essential for optimal treatment of pancreatic cancer patients. We propose a tumor detection framework to improve the detection of pancreatic head tumors on CT scans. In this retrospective research study, CT images of 99 patients with pancreatic head cancer and 98 control cases from the Catharina Hospital Eindhoven were collected. A multi-stage 3D U-Net-based approach was used for PDAC detection including clinically significant secondary features such as pancreatic duct and common bile duct dilation. The developed algorithm was evaluated using a local test set comprising 59 CT scans. The model was externally validated in 28 pancreatic cancer cases of a publicly available medical decathlon dataset. The tumor detection framework achieved a sensitivity of 0.97 and a specificity of 1.00, with an area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) of 0.99, in detecting pancreatic head cancer in the local test set. In the external test set, we obtained similar results, with a sensitivity of 1.00. The model provided the tumor location with acceptable accuracy obtaining a DICE Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 0.37. This study shows that a tumor detection framework utilizing CT scans and secondary signs of pancreatic cancer can detect pancreatic tumors with high accuracy.',\n",

       "  'AB': \"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) contributes to malnutrition, marked by muscle loss during chemotherapy for advanced pancreatic cancer (aPC). Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) is recommended for patients with EPI; however, it's efficacy for attenuating muscle loss has not been demonstrated. We aimed to delineate the impact of PERT dose on muscle loss using a 7-year population-based cohort with aPC who were provided PERT at the discretion of their oncologist or dietitian according to clinical indications of EPI. METHODS: All patients treated with chemotherapy for aPC from 2013 to 2019 in Alberta, Canada (population  approximately 4.3 million) were included if they had computed tomography (CT) scans both prior to and 12 +/- 4 weeks after chemotherapy initiation. Change in muscle area (cm(2)) was measured at 3rd lumbar level on repeated CT scans. Muscle loss was defined by measurement error (loss >2.3 cm(2)). Clinical and pharmaceutical data were retrieved from provincial registries. For patients who were dispensed PERT -8 to +6 weeks from chemo start (PERT users), estimated dose consumed per day was calculated as: (total dose dispensed) / (days, first to last dispensation). PERT users were categorized as high dose or low dose users according to the median estimated dose consumed. Non-users were classified as No PERT. Association between PERT use and muscle loss was analyzed with multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: Among 210 patients, 81 (39%) were PERT users. Median estimated dose consumed per day of 75 000 USP lipase units defined the cutoff between low dose and high dose uses. There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics between high dose and low dose groups. Muscle loss was more prevalent among low dose compared to both high dose and No PERT groups (88% vs. 58% and 67%, p < 0.05). In the multivariable model predicting muscle loss, low dose PERT was independently associated with greater odds of muscle loss (OR 5.4, p = 0.004) vs. high dose, independent of tumour response, disease stage, and chemotherapy regimen. CONCLUSION: In patients with clinical indications of EPI during chemotherapy for aPC, low doses of PERT were insufficient to prevent muscle loss. Patients with EPI consuming higher doses of PERT had similar odds of muscle maintenance to patients without clinical indications of EPI. Provider education for optimal PERT dosing in patients with EPI should be prioritized, and resources must be allocated to support dose titration.\",\n",

       "  'AB': 'Metastasis occurs frequently after resection of pancreatic cancer (PaC). In this study, we hypothesized that multi-parametric analysis of pre-metastatic liver biopsies would classify patients according to their metastatic risk, timing and organ site. Liver biopsies obtained during pancreatectomy from 49 patients with localized PaC and 19 control patients with non-cancerous pancreatic lesions were analyzed, combining metabolomic, tissue and single-cell transcriptomics and multiplex imaging approaches. Patients were followed prospectively (median 3 years) and classified into four recurrence groups; early (<6 months after resection) or late (>6 months after resection) liver metastasis (LiM); extrahepatic metastasis (EHM); and disease-free survivors (no evidence of disease (NED)). Overall, PaC livers exhibited signs of augmented inflammation compared to controls. Enrichment of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), Ki-67 upregulation and decreased liver creatine significantly distinguished those with future metastasis from NED. Patients with future LiM were characterized by scant T cell lobular infiltration, less steatosis and higher levels of citrullinated H3 compared to patients who developed EHM, who had overexpression of interferon target genes (MX1 and NR1D1) and an increase of CD11B(+) natural killer (NK) cells. Upregulation of sortilin-1 and prominent NETs, together with the lack of T cells and a reduction in CD11B(+) NK cells, differentiated patients with early-onset LiM from those with late-onset LiM. Liver profiles of NED closely resembled those of controls. Using the above parameters, a machine-learning-based model was developed that successfully predicted the metastatic outcome at the time of surgery with 78% accuracy. Therefore, multi-parametric profiling of liver biopsies at the time of PaC diagnosis may determine metastatic risk and organotropism and guide clinical stratification for optimal treatment selection.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'INTRODUCTION: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally, with a five-year survival rate of only 5%. OBJECTIVES: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is often fatal because of the lack of specific early symptoms and effective early screening tools. Therefore, 80%-85% of patients are usually diagnosed in the advanced stages. This study aimed to investigate the analgesic effect of transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. METHODS: Eighty patients with advanced pancreatic cancer were recruited from the Integrative Medicine Department of our hospital between June 2017 and October 2018 and randomly divided into the experimental group ( n = 40) and the control group ( n = 40). The experimental group received transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation combined with analgesic medication for 3 consecutive days, while the control group received only analgesic medication. The pain scores of the two groups before and after intervention were compared. RESULTS: The mean pain severity score was significantly lower in the experimental group than in the control group on day 1 ( P < 0.001), day 2 ( P < 0.001), day 3 ( P = 0.005), and day 4 ( P = 0.043). CONCLUSION: Transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation therapy effectively alleviates the pain of patients with advanced pancreatic cancer with a high degree of safety and minimal adverse effects, and is worthy of clinical application.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The burdens of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and acute pancreatitis are increasing globally. We reviewed current literature on whether acute pancreatitis is a causal factor for PDAC and examined clinical manifestations of PDAC-associated acute pancreatitis. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent findings detail the timing of acute pancreatitis before and after PDAC occurrence, further solidifying the evidence for PDAC-associated acute pancreatitis and for acute pancreatitis as a causal risk factor for PDAC. The risk of PDAC remains elevated above the general population in patients with distant history of acute pancreatitis. PDAC risk also increases with recurrent acute pancreatitis episodes, independent of smoking and alcohol. Mechanisms linking acute pancreatitis to PDAC include inflammation and neutrophil infiltration, which can be attenuated by suppressing inflammation and/or epigenetic modulation, thus slowing the progression of acinar-to-ductal metaplasia. Clinical presentation and management of acute pancreatitis in the context of PDAC are discussed, including challenges acute pancreatitis poses in the diagnosis and treatment of PDAC, and novel interventions for PDAC-associated acute pancreatitis. SUMMARY: PDAC risk may be reduced with improved acute pancreatitis prevention and treatment, such as antiinflammatories or epigenetic modulators. Increased acute pancreatitis and PDAC burden warrant more research on better diagnosis and management of PDAC-associated acute pancreatitis.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is associated with a poor prognosis, and it has a recurrence rate of >70%, even in resectable cases. The treatment strategy for recurrent PDAC involves systemic chemotherapy, with gemcitabine (GEM) monotherapy historically serving as the standard of care. The present study describes the case of a patient with PDAC and postoperative liver metastases that maintained clinical complete remission (cCR) for >7 years following GEM monotherapy. A 63-year-old woman with upper abdominal pain was diagnosed with resectable PDAC and underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy. The patient was treated with GEM + S-1 as adjuvant chemotherapy for 6 months. Multiple liver metastases were detected 15 months post-operation and the patient was administered GEM alone. After 12 cycles, computed tomography showed cCR and GEM monotherapy was discontinued after 15 cycles. The patient has had no signs or symptoms of recurrence >7 years after the first recurrence. In addition, the present study analyzed PDAC resection specimens from four patients, including this case, to determine the expression levels of hENT1 protein in the tumor tissues. hENT1 is a transmembrane protein that acts as a nucleoside transporter and is a major mediator of GEM uptake into human cells. In the present case, hENT1 staining exhibited low frequency and weak positivity in the central region, whereas a strong positive reaction was observed in nearly all cell membranes at the invasive front of the cancer. The location, intensity, and frequency of hENT1 staining varied among cases. In conclusion, the efficacy of GEM may be predicted prior to treatment by evaluating hENT1 expression.',\n",

The research involved 88 patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer who underwent surgery at the Modena Cancer Center between June 2015 and October 2023. Body composition parameters were obtained from CT scans performed before and after surgery. The percentage of sarcopenic patients at the time of diagnosis of pancreatic cancer is 56.82%. Of the patients who died between the first and second CT evaluated, 58% were sarcopenic, thus confirming the role of sarcopenia on outcome. The study found that all body composition parameters (TAMA, SMI, VFI, and SFI) demonstrated a trend towards reduction between two examinations, indicating an overall depletion in muscle and adipose tissue. We then evaluated the relationships between fat-related parameters (VFI, SFI and VSR) and survival outcomes: overall survival and progression-free survival. Cox univariate regression model show significant parameter related to outcomes was adipose tissue, specifically VFI. The study found that higher VFI levels were associated with greater survival rates. This research holds promise for advancing our understanding of the link between body composition and the prognosis of pancreatic cancer patients.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: This study aimed to evaluate the effects of sarcopenia and inflammation on the prognosis of patients with pancreatic cancer after pancreaticoduodenectomy. METHODS: Eighty patients who had undergone pancreaticoduodenectomy for pancreatic cancer between July 2010 and December 2023 were included in this study. The psoas muscle index was used to assess sarcopenia. The C-reactive protein-to-albumin ratio, prognostic nutritional index, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio were used to calculate the preoperative inflammatory marker levels. The prognostic factors for overall survival were determined using Cox regression analysis. RESULTS: Twenty-four patients were diagnosed with sarcopenia. Sarcopenia showed a significant association with advanced tumor stage. Univariate analysis revealed a significant reduction in overall survival in patients with a prognostic nutritional index of <45, C-reactive protein-to-albumin ratio of >/=0.047, cancer antigen 19-9 levels of >/=130 U/mL, sarcopenia, lymph node metastasis, and vascular invasion. Multivariate analysis revealed that a C-reactive protein-to-albumin ratio of >/=0.047 (hazards ratio, 3.383; 95% confidence interval: 1.384-8.689; p< 0.001), cancer antigen 19-9 levels of >/=130 U/mL (hazards ratio, 2.720; 95% confidence interval: 1.291-6.060; p = 0.008), sarcopenia (hazards ratio, 3.256; 95% confidence interval: 1.535-7.072; p = 0.002) and vascular invasion (hazards ratio, 2.092; 95% confidence interval: 1.057-4.170; p = 0.034) were independent predictors of overall survival. Overall survival in the sarcopenia and high C-reactive protein-to-albumin ratio groups was significantly poorer than that in the non-sarcopenia and low C-reactive protein-to-albumin ratio and sarcopenia or high C-reactive protein-to-albumin ratio groups. CONCLUSION: Sarcopenia and a high C-reactive protein-to-albumin ratio are independent prognostic factors in patients with pancreatic cancer after pancreaticoduodenectomy. Thus, sarcopenia may have a better prognostic value when combined with the C-reactive protein-to-albumin ratio.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'The diagnosis of pancreatic cancer associates an appalling significance. Detection of preinvasive stage of pancreatic cancer will ameliorate the survival of this deadly disease. Premalignant lesions such as Intraductal Papillary Mucinous Neoplasms or Mucinous Cystic Neoplasms of the pancreas are detectable on imaging exams and this permits their management prior their invasive development. Pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasms (PanIN) are the most frequent precursors of pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC), and its particular type PanIN high-grade represents the malignant non-invasive form of PDAC. Unfortunately, PanINs are not detectable on radiologic exams. Nevertheless, they can associate indirect imaging signs which would rise the diagnostic suspicion. When this suspicion is established, the patient will be enrolled in a follow-up strategy that includes performing of blood test and serial imaging test such as computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, which will cost in the best-case scenario a burden of healthcare systems, and potential mortality in the worst-case scenario when the patient underwent resection surgery, worthless when there is no moderate or high grade dysplasia in the final histopathology. This issue will be avoid having at its disposal a diagnostic technique capable of detecting high-grade PanIN lesions, such is the cytology of pancreatic juice obtained by nasopancreatic intubation. Herein, we review the possibility of detection of early malignant lesions before they become invasive PADC.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Objective The efficacy of anamorelin in pancreatic cancer (PC) patients with a poor performance status (PS) is uncertain, as previous trials have excluded such patients. This study evaluated the efficacy of anamorelin in PC patients with a poor PS (2) compared with those with a good PS (0-1). Methods We retrospectively reviewed consecutive PC patients with cachexia who received anamorelin at our institution. The primary outcome was the proportion of responders, defined as those who maintained or gained body weight and appetite over 12 weeks. The secondary outcomes included anamorelin treatment duration, proportion of patients who discontinued anamorelin within 4 weeks (early discontinuation), and the overall survival. Results Forty-five patients (35/10) were included in this study. The proportion of responders was significantly lower in patients with a poor PS than in those with a good PS (0% vs. 37%, p=0.042). Moderate weight loss (5-10%) and administration of pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy were associated with a response to anamorelin. A poor PS was significantly associated with a shorter treatment duration of anamorelin (14 vs. 93 days, p<0.001), a higher proportion of patients who discontinued anamorelin within 4 weeks (70% vs. 17%, p=0.003), and a reduced survival (62 vs. 188 days, p<0.001). A poor PS was associated with early discontinuation of anamorelin. Conclusion The efficacy of anamorelin is extremely limited in PC patients with a poor PS. Patients with PC with a poor PS may not be good candidates for anamorelin compared to those with a good PS.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Reduction in muscle mass can be routinely quantified using computed tomography (CT) of the third lumbar vertebra (L3) during a curative pancreatic cancer (PC) course. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess the association between preoperative low skeletal muscle index (SMI) measured by L3-CT and postoperative clinical outcomes in PC resectable patients. METHODS: Three electronic databases (PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus) were searched for articles published through May 2023. Duplicate titles and abstracts, full-text screening, and data extraction were performed. A meta-analysis was performed for overall survival (OS), recurrence-free survival (RFS), postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF), morbidity, and postoperative length of stay (P-LOS). The risk of bias was assessed. RESULTS: A total of 2942 patients with PC from 11 studies were identified. Preoperative low SMI was found in 50.9% of PC resectable patients. Preoperative low SMI was significantly associated with adjusted OS (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.52; 95% CI 1.25-1.86, P < 0.0001). No significant associations were found between preoperative low SMI and RFS, number of POPF, significant morbidity, and P-LOS ( P >0.05). CONCLUSIONS: SMI should be evaluated in a timely manner as a predictor of OS in PC resectable patients. Studies assessing nutritional protocols for maintaining/increasing skeletal muscle mass are required to develop a personalized nutritional approach to improve clinical outcomes.',\n",

We aimed to detect a tissue environment marker triggered by obesity-related metabolic disorders related to pancreatic cancer progression. In murine experiments, Bl6/j mice fed a normal diet (ND) or a high-fat diet (HFD) were orthotopically injected with mPKC1, a murine-derived pancreatic cancer cell line. We used stocked sera from 140 pancreatic cancer patients for analysis and 14 colon polyp patients as a disease control. Compared with ND-fed mice, HFD-fed mice exhibited obesity, larger tumors, and worse prognoses. RNA sequencing of tumors identified tenascin C (TNC) as a candidate obesity-related serum tissue environment marker with elevated expression in tumors of HFD-fed mice. Serum TNC levels were greater in HFD-fed mice than in ND-fed mice. In pancreatic cancer patients, serum TNC levels were greater than those in controls. The TNC-high group had more metabolic disorders and greater CA19-9 levels than did the TNC-low group. There was no relationship between serum TNC levels and disease stage. Among 77 metastatic patients treated with chemotherapy, a high serum TNC concentration was an independent poor prognostic factor. Pancreatic cancer patients with high serum TNC levels experienced progression more rapidly.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Cancer cachexia is a multifactorial metabolic syndrome characterized by systemic inflammation and ongoing skeletal muscle loss resulting in weakness, poor quality of life, and decreased survival. Whereas lipid accumulation in skeletal muscle is associated with cancer cachexia as well as the prognosis of cancer patients, surprisingly little is known about the nature of the lipids that accumulate in the muscle during cachexia, and whether this is related to inflammation. We aimed to identify the types and distributions of intramyocellular lipids in patients with and without cancer cachexia. METHODS: Rectus abdominis muscle biopsies were collected during surgery of patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (n = 10 without cachexia, n = 20 cachectic without inflammation (CRP < 10 mg/L), n = 10 cachectic with inflammation (CRP >/= 10 mg/L). L3-CT scans were analysed to assess body composition based on validated thresholds in Hounsfield units (HU). Muscle sections were stained with Oil-Red O and H&E to assess general lipid accumulation and atrophy. Untargeted lipidomic analyses were performed on laser-microdissected myotubes using LC-MS/MS. The spatial distribution of intramyocellular lipids with differential abundance between groups was visualized by mass-spectrometry imaging. Genes coding for inflammation markers and enzymes involved in de novo ceramide synthesis were studied by qPCR. RESULTS: Muscle radiation attenuation was lower in cachectic patients with inflammation (median 24.3 [18.6-30.8] HU) as compared with those without inflammation (34.2 [29.3-38.7] HU, P = 0.033) or no cachexia (37.4 [33.9-42.9] HU, P = 0.012). Accordingly, intramyocellular lipid content was lower in non-cachectic patients (1.9 [1.6-2.1]%) as compared with those with cachexia with inflammation (5.5 [4.5-7.3]%, P = 0.002) or without inflammation (4.8 [2.6-6.0]%, P = 0.017). Intramyocellular lipid accumulation was associated with both local IL-6 mRNA levels (r(s) = 0.57, P = 0.015) and systemic CRP levels (r(s) = 0.49, P = 0.024). Compared with non-cachectic subjects, cachectic patients had a higher relative abundance of intramyocellular glycerophospholipids and a lower relative abundance of glycerolipids. Furthermore, increases in several intramyocellular lipids such as SM(d36:1), PC(34:1), and TG(48:1) were found in cachectic patients with inflammation and correlated with specific cachexia features. Altered intramyocellular lipid species such as PC(34:1), LPC(18:2), and TG(48:1) showed an uneven distribution in muscle sections of cachectic and non-cachectic patients, with areas featuring abundance of these lipids next to areas almost devoid of them. CONCLUSIONS: Intramyocellular lipid accumulation in patients with cachexia is associated with both local and systemic inflammation, and characterized by changes in defined lipid species such as glycerolipids and glycerophospholipids.',\n",

Human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) offer an unlimited source for immune cell generation. Here, we develop human iPSC-derived CAR macrophages targeting prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA) (CAR-iMacs), which express membrane-bound interleukin (IL)-15 and truncated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) for immune cell activation and a suicide switch, respectively. These allogeneic CAR-iMacs exhibit strong antitumor activity against human pancreatic solid tumors in vitro and in vivo, leading to reduced tumor burden and improved survival in a pancreatic cancer mouse model. CAR-iMacs appear safe and do not exhibit signs of cytokine release syndrome or other in vivo toxicities. We optimized the cryopreservation of CAR-iMac progenitors that remain functional upon thawing, providing an off-the-shelf, allogeneic cell product that can be developed into CAR-iMacs. Overall, our preclinical data strongly support the potential clinical translation of this human iPSC-derived platform for solid tumors, including pancreatic cancer.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) often suffer from cachexia, a wasting syndrome that significantly reduces both quality of life and survival. Although advanced cachexia is associated with inflammatory signalling and elevated muscle catabolism, the early events driving wasting are poorly defined. During periods of nutritional scarcity, the body relies on hepatic ketogenesis to generate ketone bodies, and lipid metabolism via ketogenesis is thought to protect muscle from catabolizing during nutritional scarcity. METHODS: We developed an orthotopic mouse model of early PDAC cachexia in 12-week-old C57BL/6J mice. Murine pancreatic cancer cells (KPC) were orthotopically implanted into the pancreas of wild-type, IL-6(-/-), and hepatocyte STAT3(-/-) male and female mice. Mice were subject to fasting, 50% food restriction, ad libitum feeding or ketogenic diet interventions. We measured longitudinal body composition by EchoMRI, body mass and food intake. At the endpoint, we measured tissue mass, tissue gene expression by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, whole-body calorimetry, circulating hormone levels, faecal protein and lipid content, hepatic lipid content and ketogenic response to medium-chain fatty acid bolus. We assessed muscle atrophy in vivo and C2C12 myotube atrophy in vitro. RESULTS: Pre-cachectic PDAC mice did not preserve gastrocnemius muscle mass during 3-day food restriction (-13.1 +/- 7.7% relative to food-restricted sham, P = 0.0117) and displayed impaired fatty acid oxidation during fasting, resulting in a hypoketotic state (ketogenic response to octanoate bolus, -83.0 +/- 17.3%, P = 0.0328; Hmgcs2 expression, -28.3 +/- 7.6%, P = 0.0004). PDAC human patients display impaired fasting ketones (-46.9 +/- 7.1%, P < 0.0001) and elevated circulating interleukin-6 (IL-6) (12.4 +/- 16.5-fold increase, P = 0.0001). IL-6(-/-) PDAC mice had improved muscle mass (+35.0 +/- 3.9%, P = 0.0031) and ketogenic response (+129.4 +/- 44.4%, P = 0.0033) relative to wild-type PDAC mice. Hepatocyte-specific signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) deletion prevented muscle loss (+9.3 +/- 4.0%, P = 0.009) and improved fasting ketone levels (+52.0 +/- 43.3%, P = 0.018) in PDAC mice. Without affecting tumour growth, a carbohydrate-free diet improved tibialis anterior myofibre diameter (+16.5 +/- 3.5%, P = 0.0089), circulating ketone bodies (+333.0 +/- 117.6%, P < 0.0001) and Hmgcs2 expression (+106.5 +/- 36.1%, P < 0.0001) in PDAC mice. Ketone supplementation protected muscle against PDAC-induced atrophy in vitro (+111.0 +/- 17.6%, P < 0.0001 myofibre diameter). CONCLUSIONS: In early PDAC cachexia, muscle vulnerability to wasting is dependent on inflammation-driven metabolic reprogramming in the liver. PDAC suppresses lipid beta-oxidation and impairs ketogenesis in the liver, which is reversed in genetically modified mouse models deficient in IL-6/STAT3 signalling or through ketogenic diet supplementation. This work establishes a direct link between skeletal muscle homeostasis and hepatic metabolism. Dietary and anti-inflammatory interventions that restore ketogenesis may be a viable preventative approach for pre-cachectic patients with pancreatic cancer.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'PURPOSE: Patients have been severely suffered from cancer associated pain, and pancreatic cancer is the most severe form of cancer associated with pain. There are very few options available to manage it. The present report evaluated the effect of 5HT2A on pancreatic cancer associated pain. METHODS: Pancreatic cancer was induced by injecting SW 1,990 cells (~3x106 in a 20 muL suspension) into the pancreas and formed a 2-3-mm vesicle using an inoculator fitted with a 26-gauge needle in BALB/c-nu mice. Survival rate and body weight of the mice were observed. Pain behaviour testing was performed at the end of each week (third and fourth week) after surgery. Inflammatory mediators and HDAC 2 proteins were determined in the spinal tissue using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: There was improvement in the survival rate and body weight in 5HT2A antagonist treated group than pancreatic cancer group of mice. Moreover, 5HT2A antagonist ameliorated the alteration in pain behaviour of pancreatic cancer mice. mRNA expression of HDAC2 and level of inflammatory cytokines were reduced in the spinal tissue of 5HT 2A antagonist treated group than pancreatic cancer group of mice. CONCLUSIONS: Data revealed that 5HT2A antagonist ameliorates pain associated with pancreatic cancer mice by HDAC inhibition and inflammatory cytokines. The result of investigation supports that modulation of 5HT2A receptor could be used clinically to protects neuropathic pain in pancreatic cancer.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'OBJECTIVE: Pancreatic cancer (PC) originates and progresses with genetic mutations in various oncogenes and suppressor genes, notably KRAS, CDKN2A, TP53, and SMAD4, prevalent across diverse PC cells. In addition to genetic mutations/deletions, persistent exposure to high-risk factors, including obesity, induces whole-genome scale epigenetic alterations contributing to malignancy. However, the impact of obesity on DNA methylation in the presymptomatic stage, particularly in genes prone to PC mutation, remains uncharacterized. RESULTS: We analyzed the methylation levels of 197 loci in six genes (KRAS, CDKN2A, TP53, SMAD4, GNAS and RNF43) using Illumina Mouse Methylation BeadChip array (280 K) data from pancreatic exocrine cells obtained from high-fat-diet (HFD) induced obese mice. Results revealed no significant differences in methylation levels in loci between HFD- and normal-fat-diet (NFD)-fed mice, except for RNF43, a negative regulator of Wnt signaling, which showed hypermethylation in three loci. These findings indicate that, in mouse pancreatic exocrine cells, high-fat dietary obesity induced aberrant DNA methylation in RNF43 but not in other frequently mutated PC-related genes.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'With limited treatment options, cachexia remains a major challenge for patients with cancer. Characterizing the interplay between tumor cells and the immune microenvironment may help identify potential therapeutic targets for cancer cachexia. Herein, we investigate the critical role of macrophages in potentiating pancreatic cancer induced muscle wasting via promoting TWEAK (TNF-like weak inducer of apoptosis) secretion from the tumor. Specifically, depletion of macrophages reverses muscle degradation induced by tumor cells. Macrophages induce non-autonomous secretion of TWEAK through CCL5/TRAF6/NF-kappaB pathway. TWEAK promotes muscle atrophy by activating MuRF1 initiated muscle remodeling. Notably, tumor cells recruit and reprogram macrophages via the CCL2/CCR2 axis and disrupting the interplay between macrophages and tumor cells attenuates muscle wasting. Collectively, this study identifies a feedforward loop between pancreatic cancer cells and macrophages, underlying the non-autonomous activation of TWEAK secretion from tumor cells thereby providing promising therapeutic targets for pancreatic cancer cachexia.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) presents with a high mortality rate. Two important features of PDAC contribute to this poor outcome. The first is metastasis which occurs in ~ 80% of PDAC patients. The second is cachexia, which compromises treatment tolerance for patients and reduces their quality of life. Although various mouse models of PDAC exist, recapitulating both metastatic and cachectic features have been challenging. METHODS: Here, we optimize an orthotopic mouse model of PDAC by altering several conditions, including the subcloning of parental murine PDAC cells, implantation site, number of transplanted cells, and age of recipient mice. We perform spatial profiling to compare primary and metastatic immune microenvironments and RNA sequencing to gain insight into the mechanisms of muscle wasting in PDAC-induced cachexia, comparing non-metastatic to metastatic conditions. RESULTS: These modifications extend the time course of the disease and concurrently increase the rate of metastasis to approximately 70%. Furthermore, reliable cachexia endpoints are achieved in both PDAC mice with and without metastases, which is reminiscent of patients. We also find that cachectic muscles from PDAC mice with metastasis exhibit a similar transcriptional profile to muscles derived from mice and patients without metastasis. CONCLUSION: Together, this model is likely to be advantageous in both advancing our understanding of the mechanism of PDAC cachexia, as well as in the evaluation of novel therapeutics.',\n",

       "  'AB': \"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to systematically evaluate the efficacy and safety of Endoscopic Ultrasonography (EUS) for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. METHODS: The PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases were searched from the inception of the databases to June 2022. RevMan 5.3.0 software was utilized for data analysis. In total, 13 self-descriptive studies, which enrolled 382 patients, were finally included. RESULTS: It was revealed that EUS for the treatment of pancreatic cancer exhibited a lower incidence of adverse reactions (Relative Risk Ration [RR = 0.23], 95 % Confidence interval [95 % CI 0.23-0.23]), a higher success rate (RR = 0.90, 95 % CI 0.90-0.90), and a low failure rate (RR = 0.06, 95 % CI 0.06-0.06). Moreover, EUS-guided Celiac Plexus Neurolysis (EUS-CPN) not only significantly relieved pancreatic cancer patients' pain (RR = 0.83, 95 % CI 0.83-0.83), but also significantly eliminated pain in some patients (RR = 0.09, 95 % CI 0.09-0.09). The effects of EUS on pancreatic cancer treatment were satisfactory, and few adverse reactions were found. CONCLUSION: Owing to the restricted sample size in this meta-analysis, primarily consisting of descriptive studies, it was imperative to conduct more rigorously designed, multi-center, long-term follow-up, larger sample, and Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) to validate the findings.\",\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is still a complex, devastating disease. Cachexia symptoms frequently impair patient survival. This accompanying syndrome is commonly diagnosed late, when clinical signs become evident. Early diagnosis using conventional measurement methods is often difficult, and the discrimination of this disease from cancer progression is challenging and often overlaps. The aim of this study was to analyze whether conventional nutritional assessments or laboratory biomarkers are better predictive tools for the early detection of patients at risk of reduced survival. METHODS: We analyzed a prospective predefined cohort of 182 patients with gastrointestinal cancer, 120 patients with PDAC and-as controls-62 patients with other gastrointestinal adenocarcinoma (oAC), from whom we have sufficient data of protocol-defined conventional nutritional assessments, clinical data, and specific laboratory parameters. RESULTS: at the time of tumor diagnosis, high inflammatory biomarkers (c-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6)) and albumin serum levels were associated with impaired OS in PDAC patients, but not in patients with oAC. Hemoglobin, body mass index (BMI), and bioelectrical assessments alone did not have a prognostic impact at the time of diagnosis. In a multivariate analysis, only CRP (HR 1.91 (1.25-2.92), p = 0.003) was found to be an independent prognostic factor in PDAC patients. Over the course of the disease in PDAC patients, inflammatory biomarkers, albumin, hemoglobin, and bioelectrical assessments were associated with impaired OS. In multivariate testing, CRP (HR 2.21 (1.38-3.55), p < 0.001) and albumin (HR 1.71 (1.05-2.77), p = 0.030) were found to be independent prognostic factors in PDAC patients. CONCLUSION: Specifically for PDAC patients, high inflammatory index and albumin serum levels potentially represent a sufficient early surrogate marker to detect patients at high risk of impaired OS better than complex conventional methods. These findings could help to identify patients who may benefit from early therapeutic interventions.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'INTRODUCTION: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), the most common form of pancreatic cancer, is a particularly lethal disease that is often diagnosed late and is refractory to most forms of treatment. Tumour hypoxia is a key hallmark of PDAC and is purported to contribute to multiple facets of disease progression such as treatment resistance, increased invasiveness, metabolic reprogramming, and immunosuppression. METHODS: We used the Buffa gene signature as a hypoxia score to profile transcriptomics datasets from PDAC cases. We performed cell-type deconvolution and gene expression profiling approaches to compare the immunological phenotypes of cases with low and high hypoxia scores. We further supported our findings by qPCR analyses in PDAC cell lines cultured in hypoxic conditions. RESULTS: First, we demonstrated that this hypoxia score is associated with increased tumour grade and reduced survival suggesting that this score is correlated to disease progression. Subsequently, we compared the immune phenotypes of cases with high versus low hypoxia score expression (Hypoxia(HI) vs. Hypoxia(LOW)) to show that high hypoxia is associated with reduced levels of T cells, NK cells and dendritic cells (DC), including the crucial cDC1 subset. Concomitantly, immune-related gene expression profiling revealed that compared to Hypoxia(LOW) tumours, mRNA levels for multiple immunosuppressive molecules were notably elevated in Hypoxia(HI) cases. Using a Random Forest machine learning approach for variable selection, we identified LGALS3 (Galectin-3) as the top gene associated with high hypoxia status and confirmed its expression in hypoxic PDAC cell lines. DISCUSSION: In summary, we demonstrated novel associations between hypoxia and multiple immunosuppressive mediators in PDAC, highlighting avenues for improving PDAC immunotherapy by targeting these immune molecules in combination with hypoxia-targeted drugs.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Introduction Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen with contrast stands as the gold standard for assessing pancreatic cancer, encompassing both staging and vascular analysis. However, not all patients are suitable candidates for contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) scans due to factors such as contrast agent allergies, pregnancy, renal impairment, radiation risks, and limited tissue sampling capability in CECT scans of the abdomen. In light of these challenges, this study evaluated the diagnostic capabilities of endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) compared to CECT for staging and vascular assessment of pancreatic cancer. Methods Fifty patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer underwent evaluations using both CECT scans and EUS, focusing on staging and vascular invasion assessment. Vascular evaluation was carried out using a categorization system based on EUS findings, classifying them into three types based on the tumor-vessel relationship: Type 1 indicating clear invasion or encasement of a vessel by a tumor or contact with a vessel wall exceeding 180 degrees, Type 2 representing abutment, wherein a tumor contacts a vessel wall but at an angle less than 180 degrees, and Type 3 implying clear non-invasion, where a discernible distance exists between a tumor and a vessel. In this categorization, Type 1 and Type 2 indicated signs of vascular invasion, while Type 3 indicated vascular non-invasion. These findings were subsequently compared to the results from CECT scans. The endoscopist performing EUS was blinded to the CT outcomes prior to the examination. Results Regarding pancreatic cancer staging, EUS exhibited remarkable sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy rates of 100% according to the T criterion.As for vascular invasion assessment, EUS demonstrated sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 100%, 95.93%, and 96%, respectively, for venous invasion. For arterial invasion, the figures were 95.65% sensitivity, 100% specificity, and an overall accuracy of 99.5%. Conclusion EUS is an effective modality for evaluating both staging and vascular invasion in pancreatic cancer, boasting exceptional sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy rates. The findings are robust enough to consider EUS a viable alternative to CT scans in evaluation, with the added advantage of EUS offering tissue sampling capability.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Pancreatic cancer poses a significant challenge within the field of oncology due to its aggressive behaviour, limited treatment choices, and unfavourable outlook. With a mere 10% survival rate at the 5-year mark, finding effective interventions becomes even more pressing. The intricate relationship between desmoplasia and hypoxia in the tumor microenvironment further complicates matters by promoting resistance to chemotherapy and impeding treatment efficacy. The dense extracellular matrix and cancer-associated fibroblasts characteristic of desmoplasia create a physical and biochemical barrier that impedes drug penetration and fosters an immunosuppressive milieu. Concurrently, hypoxia nurtures aggressive tumor behaviour and resistance to conventional therapies. a comprehensive exploration of emerging medications and innovative drug delivery approaches. Notably, advancements in nanoparticle-based delivery systems, local drug delivery implants, and oxygen-carrying strategies are highlighted for their potential to enhance drug accessibility and therapeutic outcomes. The integration of these strategies with traditional chemotherapies and targeted agents reveals the potential for synergistic effects that amplify treatment responses. These emerging interventions can mitigate desmoplasia and hypoxia-induced barriers, leading to improved drug delivery, treatment efficacy, and patient outcomes in pancreatic cancer. This review article delves into the dynamic landscape of emerging anticancer medications and innovative drug delivery strategies poised to overcome the challenges imposed by desmoplasia and hypoxia in the treatment of pancreatic cancer.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Focal parenchymal atrophy and main pancreatic duct (MPD) dilatation have been identified as early signs of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. However, limited evidence exists regarding their temporal progression due to previous study limitations with restricted case numbers. OBJECTIVE: To ascertain a more precise frequency assessment of suspicious pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma findings as well as delineate the temporal progression of them. METHODS: A multicenter retrospective study was conducted on patients diagnosed with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma between 2015 and 2021. We included patients who had undergone at least one computed tomography (CT) scan >/=6 months before diagnosing pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. The temporal progression of suspicious pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma findings on CT was investigated. RESULTS: Out of 1832 patients diagnosed with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, 320 had a previous CT before their diagnosis. Suspicious pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma findings were detected in 153 cases (47.8%), with focal parenchymal atrophy (26.6%) being the most common followed by MPD dilatation (11.3%). Focal parenchymal atrophy was the earliest detectable sign among all suspicious findings and became visible on average 2.7 years before diagnosis, and the next most common, MPD dilatation, 1.1 years before diagnosis. Other findings, such as retention cysts, were less frequent and appeared around 1 year before diagnosis. Focal parenchymal atrophy followed by MPD dilatation was observed in 10 patients but not in reverse order. Focal parenchymal atrophy was more frequently detected in the pancreatic body/tail. No significant relationship was found between the pathological pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma differentiation or tumor stage and the time course of the CT findings. All cases of focal parenchymal atrophy progressed just prior to diagnosis, and the atrophic area was occupied by tumor at diagnosis. Main pancreatic duct dilatation continued to progress until diagnosis. CONCLUSION: This large-scale study revealed that the temporal progression of focal parenchymal atrophy is the earliest detectable sign indicating pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. These results provide crucial insights for early pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma detection.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'PURPOSE: The combination of gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel is an established standard treatment in the first-line treatment of metastatic ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas (mPDAC). Afatinib, an oral second-generation pan ErbB family tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has shown promising pre-clinical signs in the treatment of pancreatic cancer. The aim of this phase 1b trial was to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of afatinib in combination with gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel in patients with mPDAC. METHODS: Treatment naive patients (>/=18 years) with histologically proven mPDAC and good performance status (ECOG 0/1) were enrolled to receive gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel in combination with afatinib. Treatment was continued until disease progression, or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint MTD was determined using a 3 + 3 design. Treatment started at dose level 0 with intravenous gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel 1000 mg/m(2) / 125 mg/m(2) (day 1, 8, 15 of a 28-day cycle) + oral afatinib 30 mg daily. At dose level + 1 afatinib was increased to 40 mg. Secondary endpoints included safety parameters and exploratory endpoints evaluated treatment efficacy. RESULTS: Twelve patients were included in this trial, and 11 patients were treated and analysed in the safety and full analysis set (FAS). At dose level 0 the first three patients did not experience a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). At dose leve (DL) + 1 two patients experienced a DLT. Accordingly, enrolment continued at DL 0 with three more patients, of which one experienced DLT (skin rash >/= CTCAE grade 3). Seven patients (63.6%) experienced at least one treatment-emergent serious adverse event (TESAE), with four patients (36.4%) experiencing TESAEs grade 3-5 related to the study medication. In the FAS, the objective response rate (ORR) was 36.4%, median progression-free survival (PFS) was 3.5 months and median overall survival in nine evaluable patients was 7.5 months. CONCLUSIONS: In this phase 1b clinical trial, the MTD of gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel (1000 mg/m(2) / 125 mg/m(2)) and afatinib (30 mg) was established. In a cohort of 11 patients, the combination showed an acceptable safety profile.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Light at night, which may cause circadian disruption, is a potential pancreatic cancer risk factor. However, evidence from related exposures such as poor sleep health and shift work remains inconclusive and sparsely investigated. METHODS: We evaluated associations between self-reported typical sleep duration, chronotype, shift work, insomnia symptoms, snoring, and daytime sleeping and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDAC) incidence among 475,286 UK Biobank participants. We used Cox proportional hazards models to estimate HRs and 95% confidence intervals (CI) adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, smoking status, duration, and frequency, alcohol intake, diabetes status, race, and employment/shift work. RESULTS: Over 14 years of follow-up, 1,079 adults were diagnosed with PDAC. There were no associations observed between sleep characteristics, including sleep duration [<7 vs. 7-<9 hours; HR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.90-1.19; >/=9 hours; HR, 1.00 (0.81-1.24), evening chronotype (\"definitely\" an evening person vs. \"definitely\" a morning person; HR, 0.99 (0.77-1.29)], shift work, insomnia symptoms, snoring, or daytime sleep and PDAC risk. CONCLUSIONS: Self-reported typical sleep characteristics and shift work were not associated with PDAC risk. IMPACT: Considering the role of light at night and shift work in circadian disruption and cancer risk, it is plausible that poor sleep health among a general population may be related to cancer risk through similar sleep and circadian disrupting processes. This work may suggest that typical sleep characteristics and shift work are not associated with PDAC, although additional work is needed to confirm these findings.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Cancer cachexia is a multifactorial syndrome leading to progressive functional impairment. How cachexia affects the treatment course of chemotherapy in patients with pancreatic cancer has not been well understood. METHODS: This is an exploratory, retrospective, observational cohort study using the Japanese medical claims database from Medical Data Vision Co., Ltd. The study population included patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in whom first-line FOLFIRINOX (FFX) or gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel (GnP) was initiated between October 1, 2018, and September 30, 2020. In this study, we defined patients with cancer cachexia as those who had a weight loss of >/= 5% in the preceding 6 months. The primary outcome was time-to-treatment failure (TTF). The observation period was six months from the initiation of first-line FFX or GnP treatment. RESULTS: A total of 1897 patients (421 patients into the cachexia group; 1476 patients into the non-cachexia group) were analyzed in this study. The median TTF was 121 days (95% confidence interval [CI] 94-146) in the cachexia group and 143 days (95% CI 134-152) in the non-cachexia group. The hazard ratio for TTF of the cachexia versus non-cachexia group was 1.136 (95% CI 0.979-1.319). The median number of doses was two doses fewer in the cachexia group than in the non-cachexia group for both FFX and GnP. CONCLUSION: Cancer cachexia was suggested to be associated with shorter TTF and a reduced number of doses in patients with pancreatic cancer who received first-line FFX or GnP treatment.

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Sarcopenia is associated with poor outcomes in many malignancies. However, the relationship between sarcopenia and the prognosis of pancreatic cancer has not been well understood. The aim of this meta-analysis was to identify the prognostic value of preoperative sarcopenia in patients with pancreatic cancer after curative-intent surgery. METHODS: Database from PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science were searched from its inception to July 2023. The primary outcomes were overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and the incidence of major complications. The hazard ratio (HR), odds ratio (OR), and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to assess the relationship between preoperative sarcopenia and the prognosis of patients with pancreatic cancer. All statistical analyses were conducted by Review Manager 5.3 and STATA 17.0 software. RESULTS: A total of 23 retrospective studies involving 5888 patients were included in this meta-analysis. The pooled results demonstrated that sarcopenia was significantly associated with worse OS (HR = 1.53, P < 0.00001) and PFS (HR = 1.55, P < 0.00001). However, this association was not obvious in regard to the incidence of major complications (OR = 1.33, P = 0.11). CONCLUSION: Preoperative sarcopenia was preliminarily proved to be associated with the terrible prognosis of pancreatic cancer after surgery. However, this relationship needs to be further validated in more prospective studies.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Since computed tomography (CT) is a part of standard diagnostic protocol in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), we have evaluated the value of CT for sarcopenia screening in patients with PDAC, intending to expand the diagnostic value of tomographic studies. In our study, we included 177 patients with available CT images. Two groups were formed: Group 1 consisted of 117 patients with PDAC in various locations and stages and Group 2, or the control group, consisted of 60 \"nominally healthy\" patients with other somatic non-oncological diseases. The body mass index (BMI) was defined as a ratio of patient\\'s weight to the square of their height (kg/m2). CT-based body composition analysis was performed using commercially available software with evaluation of sarcopenia using skeletal muscle index (SMI, cm2/m2). Based on the SMI values, sarcopenia was found in 67.5% of patients (79 out of 117) in the first patient group. It was found more frequently in males (42 out of 56; 75%) than in females (37 out of 61; 60.6%). Additionally, we observed a decrease in muscle mass (hidden sarcopenia) in 79.7% in patients with a normal BMI. Even in overweight patients, sarcopenia was found in 50% (sarcopenic obesity). In patients with reduced BMI sarcopenia was found in all cases (100%). Statistically significant difference of SMI between two groups was revealed for both sexes (p = 0,0001), with no significant difference between groups in BMI. BMI is an inaccurate value for the assessment of body composition as it does not reflect in the details the human body structure. As SMI may correlate with the prognosis, decreased muscle mass- especially \"hidden\" sarcopenia or sarcopenic obesity- should be reported. The use of CT-based evaluation of sarcopenia and sarcopenic obesity will allow for a better treatment response assessment in patients with cancer cachexia.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Over the years, pancreatic cancer has experienced a global surge in incidence and mortality rates, largely attributed to the influence of obesity and diabetes mellitus on disease initiation and progression. In this study, we investigated the pathogenesis of pancreatic cancer in mice subjected to a high-fat diet (HFD) and observed an increase in citric acid expenditure. Notably, citrate treatment demonstrates significant efficacy in promoting tumor cell apoptosis, suppressing cell proliferation, and inhibiting tumor growth in vivo. Our investigations revealed that citrate achieved these effects by releasing secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC) proteins, repolarizing M2 macrophages into M1 macrophages, and facilitating tumor cell apoptosis. Overall, our research highlights the critical role of citric acid as a pivotal metabolite in the intricate relationship between obesity and pancreatic cancer. Furthermore, we uncovered the significant metabolic and immune checkpoint function of SPARC in pancreatic cancer, suggesting its potential as both a biomarker and therapeutic target in treating this patient population.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Despite the prognostic relevance of cachexia in pancreatic cancer, individual body composition has not been routinely integrated into treatment planning. In this multicenter study, we investigated the prognostic value of sarcopenia and myosteatosis automatically extracted from routine computed tomography (CT) scans of patients with advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed clinical imaging data of 601 patients from three German cancer centers. We applied a deep learning approach to assess sarcopenia by the abdominal muscle-to-bone ratio (MBR) and myosteatosis by the ratio of abdominal inter- and intramuscular fat to muscle volume. In the pooled cohort, univariable and multivariable analyses were carried out to analyze the association between body composition markers and overall survival (OS). We analyzed the relationship between body composition markers and laboratory values during the first year of therapy in a subgroup using linear regression analysis adjusted for age, sex, and American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage. RESULTS: Deep learning-derived MBR [hazard ratio (HR) 0.60, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.47-0.77, P < 0.005] and myosteatosis (HR 3.73, 95% CI 1.66-8.39, P < 0.005) were significantly associated with OS in univariable analysis. In multivariable analysis, MBR (P = 0.019) and myosteatosis (P = 0.02) were associated with OS independent of age, sex, and AJCC stage. In a subgroup, MBR and myosteatosis were associated with albumin and C-reactive protein levels after initiation of therapy. Additionally, MBR was also associated with hemoglobin and total protein levels. CONCLUSIONS: Our work demonstrates that deep learning can be applied across cancer centers to automatically assess sarcopenia and myosteatosis from routine CT scans. We highlight the prognostic role of our proposed markers and show a strong relationship with protein levels, inflammation, and anemia. In clinical practice, automated body composition analysis holds the potential to further personalize cancer treatment.',\n",

       "  'AB': \"Purpose: Ultrasound-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound (USgHIFU) represents a safe and effective non-invasive thermoablative technique for managing inoperable pancreatic cancer. This treatment method significantly alleviates disease-related symptoms and reduces pancreatic tumor volume. However, the current body of evidence is constrained by a lack of randomized controlled trials. The utilization of USgHIFU is primarily indicated for patients with unresectable, locally advanced, or metastatic pancreatic cancer, particularly those experiencing symptoms due to a locally advanced primary tumor.Methods: This collaborative consensus paper, involving European and Chinese HIFU centers treating pancreatic cancer, delineates criteria for patient selection, focusing on those most likely to benefit from USgHIFU treatment. Consideration is given to endpoints encompassing symptom alleviation, local response rates, other oncological outcomes, as well as overall and progression-free survival. Additionally, this paper defines relevant contraindications, side effects, and complications associated with USgHIFU. The publication also explores the feasibility and role of USgHIFU within the context of palliative care, including standard systemic chemotherapy.Results: The non-invasive local treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer using HIFU should be regarded as an adjunctive option alongside systemic chemotherapy or best supportive care for managing this aggressive disease. Based on the ability of USgHIFU therapy to mitigate pain and reduce primary tumor volume, it should be considered as a complementary therapy for symptomatic patients with inoperable pancreatic cancer and as a potential means of tumor debulking. The underutilized yet promising USgHIFU exhibits the potential to enhance patients' quality of life by alleviating cancer-related pain. Experts in the field should evaluate this treatment option be evaluated by experts in this field, with this consensus paper potentially serving as a guiding resource for the medical community.Conclusions: US-guided HIFU for advanced pancreatic cancer addresses treatment goals, available options, success rates, and limitations. As a non-invasive, effective local therapy, complementary to chemotherapy and best supportive care, it plays a pivotal role in pain relief, reducing of tumor volume, and potentially improving survival rates.\",\n",

       "  'AB': 'Given the increasing incidence of pancreatic cancer and the low survival rate, the exploration of the complex tumor microenvironment and the development of novel treatment options is urgent. NK cells, known for their cytotoxic abilities and modulation of other immune cells, are vital in recognizing and killing cancer cells. However, hypoxic conditions in the tumor microenvironment have been found to impair NK cell functionality and contribute to tumor immune escape. Therefore, we aimed to uncover the mechanism through which hypoxia mediates the immune escape of pancreatic cancer cells, focusing on the influence of miR-1275/AXIN2 on NK cells. Using a combination of GEO dataset screening, Tumor Immune Estimation Resource 2.0 immunoscore screening, and the Cancer Genome Atlas data, we identified a correlation between miR-1275 and NK cells. The down-regulation of miR-1275 was associated with decreased NK cell activity and survival in patients with pancreatic cancer. Pathway analysis further linked miR-1275 expression with the hypoxic HIF1A pathway. In vitro experiments were conducted using the NK-92 cell, revealing that hypoxia significantly reduced miR-1275 expression and correspondingly decreased the cell-killing ability of NK cells. Upregulation of miR-1275 increased perforin, IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha expression levels and enhanced NK cell cytotoxicity. Additionally, miR-1275 was found to bind to and inhibit AXIN2 expression, which when overexpressed, partially alleviated the promotive effect of upregulated miR-1275 on NK-92 cell killing ability. In conclusion, this research underscores the critical role of the miR-1275/AXIN2 axis in hypoxia-mediated immune escape in pancreatic cancer, thus opening new potential avenues for treatment strategies.',\n",

       "  'AB': \"Pancreatic cancer is one of the deadliest cancer types with poor treatment options. Better detection of early symptoms and relevant disease correlations could improve pancreatic cancer prognosis. In this retrospective study, we used symptom and disease codes (ICD-10) from the Danish National Patient Registry (NPR) encompassing 6.9 million patients from 1994 to 2018,, of whom 23,592 were diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. The Danish cancer registry included 18,523 of these patients. To complement and compare the registry diagnosis codes with deeper clinical data, we used a text mining approach to extract symptoms from free text clinical notes in electronic health records (3078 pancreatic cancer patients and 30,780 controls). We used both data sources to generate and compare symptom disease trajectories to uncover temporal patterns of symptoms prior to pancreatic cancer diagnosis for the same patients. We show that the text mining of the clinical notes was able to complement the registry-based symptoms by capturing more symptoms prior to pancreatic cancer diagnosis. For example, 'Blood pressure reading without diagnosis', 'Abnormalities of heartbeat', and 'Intestinal obstruction' were not found for the registry-based analysis. Chaining symptoms together in trajectories identified two groups of patients with lower median survival (<90 days) following the trajectories 'Cough-->Jaundice-->Intestinal obstruction' and 'Pain-->Jaundice-->Abnormal results of function studies'. These results provide a comprehensive comparison of the two types of pancreatic cancer symptom trajectories, which in combination can leverage the full potential of the health data and ultimately provide a fuller picture for detection of early risk factors for pancreatic cancer.\",\n",

Here, we used a Kras+/G12D TP53+/R172H Pdx1-Cre-derived (KPC-derived) model of pancreatic adenocarcinoma to examine the tumor response and adaptive resistance mechanisms involved in response to 2 established methods of hypoxia-reducing therapy: the hypoxia-activated prodrug TH-302 and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR-2) blockade. The combination of both modalities normalized tumor vasculature, increased DNA damage and cell death, and delayed tumor growth. In contrast with prior cancer models, the combination did not alleviate overall tissue hypoxia or sensitize these KPC tumors to ICB therapy despite qualitative improvements to the CD8+ T cell response. Bulk tumor RNA sequencing, flow cytometry, and adoptive myeloid cell transfer suggested that treated tumor cells increased their capacity to recruit granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (G-MDSCs) through CCL9 secretion. Blockade of the CCL9/CCR1 axis could limit G-MDSC migration, and depletion of Ly6G-positive cells could sensitize tumors to the combination of TH-302, anti-VEGFR-2, and ICB. Together, these data suggest that pancreatic tumors modulate G-MDSC migration as an adaptive response to vascular normalization and that these immunosuppressive myeloid cells act in a setting of persistent hypoxia to maintain adaptive immune resistance.',\n",

       "  'LID': '10.21037/acr-22-108 [doi] 35',\n",
       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) is an autoimmune disorder of the neuromuscular junction. It can occur as a paraneoplastic disorder associated with various types of carcinomas, usually small cell lung cancer or as an autoimmune disease. LEMS can be misdiagnosed as myasthenia gravis or as an oncological sequela, causing delays in diagnosis. We present a rare case of a male adult with confirmed LEMS occurring with pancreatic carcinoma. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 66-year-old man presented with a newly diagnosed pancreatic tumor. He had been experiencing weakness and fatigue in his lower extremities since the summer of 2020. Over time, the weakness progressed to include his proximal upper extremity muscles. Dysphonia, dysarthria, decreased appetite and significant weight loss were also observed. A computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a 3 cm locally resectable cystic tumor in the pancreatic head. Blood tests showed elevated carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels. A Whipple procedure was performed, which revealed a poorly differentiated pancreatic adenocarcinoma inside an intraductal pancreatic mucinous neoplasm. Postoperatively, the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) because he had no spontaneous breathing and manifested areflexia signs. A train of four (TOF) monitoring of peripheral nerve stimulation was performed and pyridostigmine therapy was initiated, leading to an improvement in symptoms allowing the extubation and transfer to the peripheral ward. Further diagnostic tests revealed a LEMS and an intravenous therapy with cumulative 100 g immunoglobulin (Ig) G was initiated. Upon discharge, 10 days after starting LEMS treatment, the patient showed subjective and objective improvement in strength. CONCLUSIONS: Paraneoplastic syndromes are more common than expected, but rare in pancreatic adenocarcinoma. They can appear before abdominal symptoms, facilitating early diagnosis. Successful treatment of cancer may eliminate paraneoplastic symptoms. LEMS may reveal pancreatic cancer. Early recognition of paraneoplastic syndromes is important for pancreatic cancer management. Further investigation is needed to evaluate the diagnostic approach for LEMS in all patients with pancreatic cancer.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'To evaluation the feasibility of Iodine-125 ((1)(2)5I) brachytherapy combined with arterial infusion chemotherapy in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. A total of 72 cases with Stage III and IV were retrospectively reviewed. 23 cases receiving 125I brachytherapy were classified as Group A. 27 cases receiving arterial infusion chemotherapy (gemcitabine + cisplatin, GP) were classified as Group B and 22 cases receiving 125I brachytherapy combined with arterial infusion chemotherapy (GP) were classified as Group C. The evaluated indications were local control rate, survival rate, carbohydrate antigen 19-9, pain relief, and Karnofsky physical scores. Analysis of Variancep, Pearson chi-square test and Kaplan-Meier curves were used for analysis. The local control rate of group A and group C was significantly higher than group B (P < .001). Pearson chi-square test showed statistical difference of the 3 groups (chi2 = 12.969, P = .044). The median survival of group A,B and C was 9 months, 6 months and 13 months, respectively. The survival time of group C was significantly higher than group B (chi2 = 5.403, P = .020). The Log rank test showed statistical difference in the survival curve of the 3 groups (chi2 = 6.501, P = .039). The difference of carbohydrate antigen 19-9 decline percentage between group B and C group was statistically significant (chi2 = 5.959, P = .015). Patients in group A and group C relieved form pain after treatment with statistically significant (P < .001). Pain relief was much more effective in patients who received 125I brachytherapy. Karnofsky physical scores after treatment were statistically higher than those before treatment in each group (P < .001). 125I brachytherapy maybe one of the effective, safe and feasible alternative treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer. (1)(2)5I brachytherapy combined with arterial infusion chemotherapy was effective in the treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'The rising pancreatic cancer incidence due to obesity and type 2 diabetes is closely tied to hyperinsulinemia, an independent cancer risk factor. Previous studies demonstrated reducing insulin production suppressed pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) pre-cancerous lesions in Kras-mutant mice. However, the pathophysiological and molecular mechanisms remained unknown, and in particular it was unclear whether hyperinsulinemia affected PanIN precursor cells directly or indirectly. Here, we demonstrate that insulin receptors (Insr) in Kras(G12D)-expressing pancreatic acinar cells are dispensable for glucose homeostasis but necessary for hyperinsulinemia-driven PanIN formation in the context of diet-induced hyperinsulinemia and obesity. Mechanistically, this was attributed to amplified digestive enzyme protein translation, triggering of local inflammation, and PanIN metaplasia in vivo. In vitro, insulin dose-dependently increased acinar-to-ductal metaplasia formation in a trypsin- and Insr-dependent manner. Collectively, our data shed light on the mechanisms connecting obesity-driven hyperinsulinemia and pancreatic cancer development.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) represents one of the most aggressive solid tumors with a dismal prognosis and an increasing incidence. At the time of diagnosis, more than 85% of patients are in an unresectable stage. For these patients, chemotherapy can prolong survival by only a few months. Unfortunately, in recent decades, no groundbreaking therapies have emerged for PDAC, thus raising the question of how to identify novel therapeutic druggable targets to improve prognosis. Recently, the tumor microenvironment and especially its neural component has gained increasing interest in the pancreatic cancer field. A histological hallmark of PDAC is perineural invasion (PNI), whereby cancer cells invade surrounding nerves, providing an alternative route for metastatic spread. The extent of PNI has been positively correlated with early tumor recurrence and reduced overall survival. Multiple studies have shown that mechanisms involved in PNI are also involved in tumor spread and pain generation. Targeting these pathways has shown promising results in alleviating pain and reducing PNI in preclinical models. In this review, we will describe the mechanisms and future treatment strategies to target this mutually trophic interaction between cancer cells to open novel avenues for the treatment of patients diagnosed with PDAC.',\n",

       "  'AB': \"PURPOSE: Pancreatic cancer is one of the most aggressive malignant tumors with poor prognosis. High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is an effective and safe treatment option for advanced pancreatic cancer, however, the survival time of patients after the treatment was different. So, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship between the high-risk characteristics and prognosis of unresectable pancreatic cancer after HIFU treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This prospective study included 30 patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer who received HIFU at Beijing Friendship Hospital. Data on patients' tumor size, pain scores, peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets, CA19-9 and contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) features were collected to assess the relationship with overall survival (OS) after HIFU. RESULTS: The median OS from the start of HIFU treatment was 159 days, 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 108-210. The levels of pain were determined by visual analogue scale (VAS) score, and the quartile of the score decreased from 6 (2, 7) to 4 (2, 5) immediately after one session of the treatment (p = 0.001). The diagnostic model showed that high post VAS score and decreasing of peripheral CD4(+) T cells were significantly correlated with poor prognosis (p < 0.05), and showed good discrimination ability (AUC = 0.848, 95% CI = 0.709-0.987). CONCLUSION: HIFU can effectively relieve pain in patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer. Post treatment VAS and change of peripheral CD4(+) T cells are independent risk factors affecting the prognosis in patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer after HIFU treatment.\",\n",

       "  'AB': \"Long non-coding RNAs are considered to be key regulatory factors of oncogenesis and tumor progression. It is reported that LINC00460 plays the role of oncogene in some tumors. However, LINC00460's role and mechanism of action in pancreatic cancer have not yet been fully elucidated. We identified LINC00460 by analyzing data from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. The role of LINC00460 in proliferation and metastasis was examined using CCK8, colony formation, wound healing, and transwell assays. The potential mechanisms of LINC00460 in regulating mRNA levels were elucidated by RNA pull-down, RNA immunoprecipitation, Chromatin immunoprecipitation, Co-immunoprecipitation, and Immunofluorescence assays. The results showed that LINC00460 was upregulated in pancreatic cancer cells and tissues. Highly expressed LINC00460 is significantly related to short survival of pancreatic cancer patients. Inhibition of LINC00460 attenuated pancreatic cancer cell proliferation and metastasis, whereas its overexpression reversed this effect. Mechanically, LINC00460 is induced by hypoxia, through binding of the hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha in the promoter region of LINC00460. Furthermore, LINC00460 functioned as an miR-4689 sponge to regulate the downstream target gene UBE2V1, enhancing the stability of mutant p53 in pancreatic cancer cells. LINC00460 also further promotes pancreatic cancer development by sequestering USP10, a cytoplasmic ubiquitin-specific protease that deubiquitinates p53 and enhances its stability. Collectively, our study demonstrated that LINC00460 is a hypoxia-induced lncRNA that plays the role of oncogene in pancreatic cancer by modulating the miR-4689/UBE2V1 axis, sequestering USP10, and ultimately enhancing the stability of mutant p53.\",\n",

       "  'AB': 'Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), a highly lethal disease with limited therapeutic options, may benefit from repurposing of FDA-approved drugs in preventive or interceptive strategies in high-risk populations. Previous animal studies demonstrated that the use of metformin and statins as single agents at relatively high doses restrained PDAC development. Here, four-week-old mice expressing KrasG12D in all pancreatic lineages (KC mice) and fed an obesogenic high fat, high calorie diet that promotes early PDAC development were randomized onto low dosage metformin, simvastatin, or both drugs in combination administered orally. Dual treatment attenuated weight gain, fibro-inflammation, and development of advanced PDAC precursor lesions (pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia [PanIN]-3) in male KC mice, without significant effect in females or when administered individually. Dual-treated KC mice had reduced proliferation of PanIN cells and decreased transcriptional activity of the Hippo effectors, YAP and TAZ, which are important regulators of PDAC development. Metformin and simvastatin also synergistically inhibited colony formation of pancreatic cancer cells in vitro. Together, our data demonstrated that a combination of low doses of metformin and simvastatin inhibits PDAC development and imply that both drugs are promising agents for being tested in clinical trials for preventing pancreatic cancer progression.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Pancreatic cancer (PC) has a poor prognosis, with body weight loss commonly observed at diagnosis. However, the impact on PC prognosis of weight loss at the time of diagnosis on PC prognosis is unknown. METHODS: This retrospective, single-center study enrolled consecutively patients diagnosed with metastatic or locally advanced PC or resectable PC who were intolerant of or refused surgery. Patients who had lost more than 5% of their body weight or more than 2% and had a body mass index (BMI) of less than 20 kg/m(2) at diagnosis were classified as experiencing body weight loss. Patients were subclassified into 2 groups: patients with and without weight loss. The study evaluated patient-related and PC-related factors affecting prognosis. Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess factors affecting prognosis. The primary endpoint was overall survival. Additionally, 1:1 propensity score matching was performed to reduce bias. RESULTS: In total, 220 patients were included in the study. The median age of the patients was 74 years, and 49.1% were male. Weight loss at diagnosis was observed in 43.2% of patients. There were no significant differences in clinical factors, except for anthropometric parameters, between the groups. The median survival time did not differ between the weight loss and no weight loss groups (149 and 173 days, respectively, P = .669). After matching, no significant differences in survival times were observed between the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS: This study found no association between weight loss at diagnosis and prognosis in patients with advanced PC treated with best supportive care or chemotherapy.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Hypoxia plays an important role in pancreatic cancer progression. It drives various metabolic reprogramming in cells including that of lipids, which in turn, can modify the structure and function of cell membranes. Homeostatic adaptation of membranes is well-recognized, but how and if it is regulated in hypoxic pancreatic cancer and its relation to aggressive phenotype and metastasis remains elusive. Here we show hypoxia-induced extensive global lipid remodelling spanning changes in lipid classes, unsaturation levels, glyceryl backbone and acyl chain lengths. No major modulation of plasma membrane biophysical properties revealed a decoupling of lipidome modulation from membrane properties under hypoxia. This was supported by observing minor changes in the lipidome of plasma membranes under hypoxia. Further, hypoxia increased migration and invasion underpinned by reduced actin volume, cell cortical stiffness and facile tether dynamics. In conclusion, we demonstrate buffering of the lipidome alterations leading to a homeostatic membrane response. These findings will help to understand the hypoxic regulation of pancreatic membrane homeostasis and identify tangible theranostic avenues.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Pancreatic cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer death in Western societies. Its late diagnosis and resistance to chemotherapies result in a high mortality rate; thus, the development of more effective therapies for the treatment of pancreatic cancer is strongly warranted. Usnic acid (UA) is a secondary metabolite of lichens that shows modest antiproliferative activity toward cancer cells. Recently, we reported the synthesis of a UA pyrazole derivative, named 5, which was more active than the parent compound toward cervical cancer cells. Here, its anticancer potential has been evaluated in detail in other cancer cells, particularly pancreatic cancer cells. METHODS: The impact of UA and derivative 5 on cell viability, morphology, cell cycle, and death was assessed using the MTT test, electron microscopy, flow cytometry, and immunoblotting, respectively. The calcium ions level was detected fluorometrically. In vivo, the anticancer activity of 5 was evaluated in a murine xenograft model. RESULTS: Derivative 5 inhibited the viability of different cancer cells. Noncancerous cells were less sensitive. It induced the release of calcium ions from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and ER stress, which was manifested by cell vacuolization. It was accompanied by G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and cell death of pancreatic cancer cells. When applied to nude mice with xenografted pancreatic cancer cells, 5 inhibited tumor growth, with no signs of kidney or liver toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: UA derivative 5 is superior to UA inhibiting the growth and proliferation of pancreatic cancer cells. ER stress exaggeration is a mechanism underlying the activity of derivative 5.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'PURPOSE: Clinical evidence is limited regarding palliative radiation therapy for relieving pancreatic cancer-related pain. We prospectively investigated pain response after short-course palliative radiation therapy in patients with moderate-to-severe pancreatic cancer-related pain. METHODS AND MATERIALS: In this prospective phase 2 single center nonrandomized trial, 30 patients with moderate-to-severe pain (5-10, on a 0-10 scale) of pancreatic cancer refractory to pain medication, were treated with a short-course palliative radiation therapy; 24 Gy in 3 weekly fractions (2015-2018). Primary endpoint was defined as a clinically relevant average decrease of >/=2 points in pain severity, compared with baseline, within 7 weeks after the start of treatment. Secondary endpoint was global quality of life (QoL), with a clinically relevant increase of 5 to 10 points (0-100 scale). Pain severity reduction and QoL were assessed 9 times using the Brief Pain Inventory and European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-C15-PAL, respectively. Both outcomes were analyzed using joint modeling. In addition, acute toxicity based on clinician reporting and overall survival (OS) were assessed. RESULTS: Overall, 29 of 30 patients (96.7%) received palliative radiation therapy. At baseline, the median oral morphine equivalent daily dose was 129.5 mg (range, 20.0-540.0 mg), which decreased to 75.0 mg (range, 15.0-360.0 mg) after radiation (P = .021). Pain decreased on average 3.15 points from baseline to 7 weeks (one-sided P = .045). Patients reported a clinically relevant mean pain severity reduction from 5.9 to 3.8 points (P = .011) during the first 3 weeks, which further decreased to 3.2 until week 11, ending at 3.4 (P = .006) in week 21 after the first radiation therapy fraction. Global QoL significantly improved from 50.5 to 60.8 during the follow-up period (P = .001). Grade 3 acute toxicity occurred in 3 patients and no grade 4 to 5 toxicity was observed. Median OS was 11.8 weeks, with a 13.3% 1-year actuarial OS rate. CONCLUSIONS: Short-course palliative radiation therapy for pancreatic cancer-related pain was associated with rapid, clinically relevant reduction in pain severity, and clinically relevant improvement in global QoL, with mostly mild toxicity.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'PURPOSE: The standard of care in resectable and borderline resectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has evolved to include neoadjuvant treatment before surgical resection. Current guidelines call for obtaining histologic tissue diagnosis via endoscopic ultrasound fine-needle aspiration before administration of neoadjuvant therapy, which differ from guidelines discouraging delay in surgical resection for a biopsy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Whether to proceed with treatment before a biopsy confirms that malignancy is a nuanced decision and includes considerations of physical and psychological risks entailed in both pursuing and forgoing a biopsy. RESULTS: Accuracy of imaging and biopsy results, the presence of contributing clinical signs/symptoms, and the existing precedents of considering biopsies as waivable such as in scenarios with high clinical suspicion and primary surgical resection. CONCLUSION: When considering the aspects of ethical medical practice including beneficence (doing good), nonmaleficence (avoiding harm), autonomy (allowing patients to make decisions about their care), and utilitarianism (doing the most good for the most people), analysis of whether guidelines guiding biopsies should continue to differ between resection and neoadjuvant treatments in PDAC is prudent.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'OBJECTIVE: To investigate the safety, local ablation efficacy, analgesic effects, and factors influencing the survival of patients with advanced pancreatic cancer treated with high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with advanced pancreatic cancer who underwent HIFU for the first time at the Suining Central Hospital between January 2018 and September 2022 were enrolled. The efficacy of tumor ablation was assessed using enhanced computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), pain relief was assessed using the visual analog scale (VAS), and complications and survival rates were investigated. The Kaplan-Meier method and a Cox regression model were used to analyze the independent risk factors that may have affected prognosis. RESULTS: Intraoperative ultrasonography showed varying degrees of grayscale changes in all cases. One month after surgery, enhanced computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging examinations showed complete or partial responses in 85.22% of the patients. Pain relief was achieved in 98.21% of the patients. No postoperative complications of SIR-C grade or higher were observed. The overall median survival time (MST) was 12.1 months. Cox multifactorial analysis showed that the main factors affecting overall survival (OS) were clinical stage, preoperative liver function, and combination chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: HIFU is safe and effective for pancreatic cancer treatment, and has the potential to become an important supplement for the treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer. This approach needs to be further verified by multi-center and large-sample studies.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Cancer cachexia, and its associated complications, represent a large and currently untreatable roadblock to effective cancer management. Many potential therapies have been proposed and tested-including appetite stimulants, targeted cytokine blockers, and nutritional supplementation-yet highly effective therapies are lacking. Innovative approaches to treating cancer cachexia are needed. Members of the Kruppel-like factor (KLF) family play wide-ranging and important roles in the development, maintenance, and metabolism of skeletal muscle. Within the KLF family, we identified KLF10 upregulation in a multitude of wasting contexts-including in pancreatic, lung, and colon cancer mouse models as well as in human patients. We subsequently interrogated loss-of-function of KLF10 as a potential strategy to mitigate cancer associated muscle wasting. In vivo studies leveraging orthotopic implantation of pancreas cancer cells into wild-type and KLF10 KO mice revealed significant preservation of lean mass and robust suppression of pro-atrophy muscle-specific ubiquitin ligases Trim63 and Fbxo32, as well as other factors implicated in atrophy, calcium signaling, and autophagy. Bioinformatics analyses identified Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta), a known inducer of KLF10 and cachexia promoting factor, as a key upstream regulator of KLF10. We provide direct in vivo evidence that KLF10 KO mice are resistant to the atrophic effects of TGF-beta. ChIP-based binding studies demonstrated direct binding to Trim63, a known wasting-associated atrogene. Taken together, we report a critical role for the TGF-beta/KLF10 axis in the etiology of pancreatic cancer-associated muscle wasting and highlight the utility of targeting KLF10 as a strategy to prevent muscle wasting and limit cancer-associated cachexia.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Pancreatic cancer is often incurable and can be associated with significant pain and abdominal symptoms. This study aims to characterize the symptomatic burden of patients with pancreatic cancer receiving palliative radiotherapy and the corresponding symptomatic and radiographic responses. METHODS: Patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma referred to BC Cancer for palliative radiation from 2006 to 2013 were retrospectively reviewed. Logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards model were used to evaluate variables predictive of symptomatic response and survival respectively. RESULTS: One hundred patients were identified. The majority had good performance status (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group score 0-1, 82%), received only one line of chemotherapy (91%), and presented with pain (84%). The most common radiotherapy prescription was 30 Gy in 10 fractions (22%). Pain improved in 69%, early satiety and bloating improved in 59%, and hemostasis was achieved in 73% of cases. Treatment toxicity occurred in 47% of cases and were predominantly grade 1-2 with 1 case of grade 3 toxicity. Median survival was 5.1 months. Tumor size, radiotherapy dose, and concurrent chemotherapy were not predictive of symptomatic response nor prolonged survival. CONCLUSIONS: In the largest cohort to date evaluating palliative radiotherapy in pancreatic adenocarcinoma, radiation was efficacious in improving pain and gastrointestinal bleeding and was generally well-tolerated. Additional studies on the efficacy and optimal prescriptions for palliative radiotherapy are necessary in this population.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the prognostic value of CT-based markers of sarcopenia and myosteatosis in comparison to the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score for survival of patients with advanced pancreatic cancer treated with high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU). MATERIALS AND METHODS: For 142 retrospective patients, the skeletal muscle index (SMI), skeletal muscle radiodensity (SMRD), fatty muscle fraction (FMF), and intermuscular fat fraction (IMFF) were determined on superior mesenteric artery level in pre-interventional CT. Each marker was tested for associations with sex, age, body mass index (BMI), and ECOG. The prognostic value of the markers was examined in Kaplan-Meier analyses with the log-rank test and in uni- and multivariable Cox proportional hazards (CPH) models. RESULTS: The following significant associations were observed: Male patients had higher BMI and SMI. Patients with lower ECOG had lower BMI and SMI. Patients with BMI lower than 21.8 kg/m(2) (median) also showed lower SMI and IMFF. Patients younger than 63.3 years (median) were found to have higher SMRD, lower FMF, and lower IMFF. In the Kaplan-Meier analysis, significantly lower survival times were observed in patients with higher ECOG or lower SMI. Increased patient risk was observed for higher ECOG, lower BMI, and lower SMI in univariable CPH analyses for 1-, 2-, and 3-year survival. Multivariable CPH analysis for 1-year survival revealed increased patient risk for higher ECOG, lower SMI, lower IMFF, and higher FMF. In multivariable analysis for 2- and 3-year survival, only ECOG and FMF remained significant. CONCLUSION: CT-based markers of sarcopenia and myosteatosis show a prognostic value for assessment of survival in advanced pancreatic cancer patients undergoing HIFU therapy. CLINICAL RELEVANCE STATEMENT: The results indicate a greater role of myosteatosis for additional risk assessment beyond clinical scores, as only FMF was associated with long-term survival in multivariable CPH analyses along ECOG and also showed independence to ECOG in group analysis. KEY POINTS: * This study investigates the prognostic value of CT-based markers of sarcopenia and myosteatosis for patients with pancreatic cancer treated with high-intensity focused ultrasound. * Markers for sarcopenia and myosteatosis showed a prognostic value besides clinical assessment of the physical status by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group score. In contrast to muscle size measurements, the myosteatosis marker fatty muscle fraction demonstrated independence to the clinical score. * The results indicate that myosteatosis might play a greater role for additional patient risk assessments beyond clinical assessments of physical status.',\n",

Whether adipose tissue and skeletal muscle losses begin before diagnosis and the potential utility of such losses for earlier cancer detection are not well understood. We quantify skeletal muscle and adipose tissue areas from computed tomography (CT) imaging obtained 2 months to 5 years before cancer diagnosis in 714 pancreatic cancer cases and 1748 matched controls. Adipose tissue loss is identified up to 6 months, and skeletal muscle wasting is identified up to 18 months before the clinical diagnosis of pancreatic cancer and is not present in the matched control population. Tissue losses are of similar magnitude in cases diagnosed with localized compared with metastatic disease and are not correlated with at-diagnosis circulating levels of CA19-9. Skeletal muscle wasting occurs in the 1-2 years before pancreatic cancer diagnosis and may signal an upcoming diagnosis of pancreatic cancer.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Perivascular cuffing as the sole imaging manifestation of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an under-recognized entity. OBJECTIVES: To present this rare finding and differentiate it from retroperitoneal fibrosis and vasculitis. METHODS: Patients with abdominal vasculature cuffing were retrospectively collected (January 2011 to September 2017). We evaluated vessels involved, wall thickness, length of involvement and extra-vascular manifestations. RESULTS: Fourteen patients with perivascular cuffing were retrieved: three with celiac and superior mesenteric artery (SMA) perivascular cuffing as the only manifestation of surgically proven PDAC, seven with abdominal vasculitis, and four with retroperitoneal fibrosis. PDAC patients exhibited perivascular cuffing of either or both celiac and SMA (3/3). Vasculitis patients showed aortitis with or without iliac or SMA cuffing (3/7) or cuffing of either or both celiac and SMA (4/7). Retroperitoneal fibrosis involved the aorta (4/4), common iliac (4/4), and renal arteries (2/4). Hydronephrosis was present in 3/4 of retroperitoneal fibrosis patients. PDAC and vasculitis demonstrated reduced wall thickness in comparison to retroperitoneal fibrosis (PDAC: 1.0 +/- 0.2 cm, vasculitis: 1.2 +/- 0.5 cm, retroperitoneal fibrosis: 2.4 +/- 0.4 cm; P = 0.002). There was no significant difference in length of vascular involvement (PDAC: 6.3 +/- 2.1 cm, vasculitis: 7.1 +/- 2.6 cm, retroperitoneal fibrosis: 8.7 +/- 0.5 cm). CONCLUSIONS: Celiac and SMA perivascular cuffing can be the sole finding in PDAC and may be indistinguishable from vasculitis. This entity may differ from retroperitoneal fibrosis as it spares the aorta, iliac, and renal arteries and demonstrates thinner walls and no hydronephrosis.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Cancer-associated cachexia (CAC) is a critical contributor to pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) mortality. Thus, there is an urgent need for new strategies to mitigate PDAC-associated cachexia; and the exploration of dietary interventions is a critical component. We previously observed that a ketogenic diet (KD) combined with gemcitabine enhances overall survival in the autochthonous LSL-KrasG12D/+; LSL-Trp53 R172H/+; Pdx1-Cre (KPC) mouse model. In this study, we investigated the effect and cellular mechanisms of a KD in combination with gemcitabine on the maintenance of skeletal muscle mass in KPC mice. For this purpose, male and female pancreatic tumor-bearing KPC mice were allocated to a control diet (CD), a KD, a CD + gemcitabine (CG), or a KD + gemcitabine (KG) group. We observed that a KD or a KG-mitigated muscle strength declined over time and presented higher gastrocnemius weights compared CD-fed mice. Mechanistically, we observed sex-dependent effects of KG treatment, including the inhibition of autophagy, and increased phosphorylation levels of eIF2alpha in KG-treated KPC mice when compared to CG-treated mice. Our data suggest that a KG results in preservation of skeletal muscle mass. Additional research is warranted to explore whether this diet-treatment combination can be clinically effective in combating CAC in PDAC patients.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: There are conflicting data on whether nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is associated with susceptibility to pancreatic cancer. Using Mendelian randomization (MR), we investigated the relationship between genetic predisposition to NAFLD and risk for pancreatic cancer. METHODS: Data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) within the Pancreatic Cancer Cohort Consortium (PanScan; cases n = 5,090, controls n = 8,733) and the Pancreatic Cancer Case Control Consortium (PanC4; cases n = 4,163, controls n = 3,792) were analyzed. We used data on 68 genetic variants with four different MR methods [inverse variance weighting (IVW), MR-Egger, simple median, and penalized weighted median] separately to predict genetic heritability of NAFLD. We then assessed the relationship between each of the four MR methods and pancreatic cancer risk, using logistic regression to calculate ORs and 95% confidence intervals (CI), adjusting for PC risk factors, including obesity and diabetes. RESULTS: No association was found between genetically predicted NAFLD and pancreatic cancer risk in the PanScan or PanC4 samples [e.g., PanScan, IVW OR, 1.04; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.88-1.22; MR-Egger OR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.65-1.21; PanC4, IVW OR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.90-1.27; MR-Egger OR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.67-1.28]. None of the four MR methods indicated an association between genetically predicted NAFLD and pancreatic cancer risk in either sample. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic predisposition to NAFLD is not associated with pancreatic cancer risk. IMPACT: Given the close relationship between NAFLD and metabolic conditions, it is plausible that any association between NAFLD and pancreatic cancer might reflect host metabolic perturbations (e.g., obesity, diabetes, or metabolic syndrome) and does not necessarily reflect a causal relationship between NAFLD and pancreatic cancer.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play important roles in hypoxia-induced tumor processes. However, the prognostic value of hypoxia-related lncRNAs in pancreatic cancer is limited. METHODS: Hypoxia-related lncRNAs were identified by coexpression analysis and the LncTarD database. LASSO analysis was performed to develop a prognostic model. The function of TSPOAP1-AS1 was studied in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS: We recognized a set of fourteen hypoxia-related lncRNAs for the construction of a prognostic model. The prognostic model displayed excellent performance in predicting the prognosis of pancreatic cancer patients. The overexpression of TSPOAP1-AS1, a hypoxia-related lncRNA, attenuated the proliferation and invasion of pancreatic cancer cells. HIF-1alpha bound to the promoter of TSPOAP1-AS1 and impaired its transcription under hypoxia. CONCLUSION: The hypoxia-related lncRNA assessment model might be a potential strategy for prognostic prediction in pancreatic cancer. The fourteen lncRNAs contained in the model could be helpful for uncovering the mechanisms of pancreatic tumorigenesis.',\n",

       "  'AB': \"BACKGROUND: Isolated pulmonary oligometastases as the first site of dissemination after initial resection of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PC) is a rare event, and the treatment in this subgroup is challenging. Recurrence in the lung after initial primary tumour resection is associated with the most long-term survivors of patients with metastatic PC. Stereotactic ablative body radiation therapy (SABR) or metastectomy for pulmonary oligometastases from PC is becoming more common. However, patients with close or positive margins after metastectomy for isolated pulmonary metastatic PC are at high risk for recurrence. This requires a treatment capable of achieving high rates of local control and improved quality of life by delaying the need for systemic chemotherapy. In other settings, SABR has been shown to achieve these goals, allowing safe dose escalation with excellent conformity and short duration of treatment. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 48-year old Caucasian man with a history of locally advanced PC initially treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by Whipple's resection in August 2016. After a disease-free interval of 3 years, he developed three isolated pulmonary metastases which were treated with local resection. In the setting of microscopically positive resection margins (R1), adjuvant lung SABR was delivered to all three sites. His treated lung disease remained radiologically stable for up to twenty months after SABR. Treatment was well tolerated. In January 2021, he developed a malignant pre-tracheal node which was treated with conventionally fractionated radiotherapy and remained controlled for the duration of follow-up. A year later, he developed widespread metastatic disease including pleura, bone and adrenal gland, together with presumed progression in one of the original lung lesions, receiving palliative radiotherapy for right chest wall pain. He was later found to have an intracranial metastasis and died in February 2022, 5(1/2) years after initial treatment. CONCLUSION: We present the case of a patient treated with SABR after R1 resection of 3 isolated pulmonary metastases from PC, with no treatment toxicities and durable local control. For well-selected patients in this setting, adjuvant lung SABR may be a safe and effective treatment option.\",\n",

       "  'AB': \"OBJECTIVE: This study assessed the impact of pancreatic cancer (PC) pain on associated symptoms, activities, and resource utilization from 2016 to 2020 in an online patient registry. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Responses from PC patient volunteers (N = 1978) were analyzed from online surveys in a cross-sectional study. Comparisons were performed between PC patient groups reporting, (1) the presence vs. absence of pre-diagnosis PC pain, (2) high (4-8) vs. low (0-3) pain intensity scores on an 11-point numerical rating scale (NRS), and (3) year of PC diagnosis (2010-2020). Descriptive statistics and all bivariate analyses were performed using Chi-square or Fisher's Exact tests. RESULTS: PC pain was the most frequently reported pre-diagnosis symptom (62%). Pre-diagnostic PC pain was reported more frequently by women, those with a younger age at diagnosis, and those with PC that spread to the liver and peritoneum. Those with pre-diagnostic PC pain vs. those without reported higher pain intensities (2.64 +/- 2.54 vs.1.56 +/- 2.01 NRS mean +/- SD, respectively, P = .0039); increased frequencies of post-diagnosis symptoms of cramping after meals, feelings of indigestion, and weight loss (P = .02-.0001); and increased resource utilization in PC pain management: (ER visits N = 86 vs. N = 6, P = .018 and analgesic prescriptions, P < .03). The frequency of high pain intensity scores was not decreased over a recent 11-year span. CONCLUSIONS: PC pain continues to be a prominent PC symptom. Patients reporting pre-diagnosis PC pain experience increased GI metastasis, symptoms burden, and are often undertreated. Its mitigation may require novel treatments, more resources dedicated to ongoing pain management and surveillance to improve outcomes.\",\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Cancer cachexia, occurring in ~ 80% pancreatic cancer (PC) patients overall, is a paraneoplastic syndrome mediated by cancer-induced systemic inflammation and characterized by weight loss and skeletal muscle wasting. Identifying clinically relevant PC-derived pro-inflammatory factors with cachexigenic potential may provide novel insights and therapeutic strategies. METHODS: Pro-inflammatory factors with cachexigenic potential in PC were identified by bioinformatic analysis. The abilities of selected candidate factors in inducing skeletal muscle atrophy were investigated. Expression levels of candidate factors in tumors and sera was compared between PC patients with and without cachexia. Associations between serum levels of the candidates and weight loss were assessed in PC patients. RESULTS: S100A8, S100A9, and S100A8/A9 were identified and shown to induce C2C12 myotube atrophy. Tumors of PC patients with cachexia had markedly elevated expression of S100A8 (P = 0.003) and S100A9 (P < 0.001). PC patients with cachexia had significantly higher serum levels of S100A8, S100A9 and S100A8/A9. Serum levels of these factors positively correlated with percentage of weight loss [correlation coefficient: S100A8: 0.33 (P < 0.001); S100A9: 0.30 (P < 0.001); S100A8/A9: 0.24 (P = 0.004)] and independently predicted the occurrence of cachexia [adjusted odds ratio (95% confidence interval) per 1ng/ml increase: S100A8 1.11 (1.02-1.21), P = 0.014; S100A9 1.10 (1.04-1.16), P = 0.001; per 1 microg/ml increase: S100A8/A9 1.04 (1.01-1.06), P = 0.009]. CONCLUSIONS: Atrophic effects of S100A8, S100A9, and S100A8/A9 indicated them as potential pathogenic factors of PC-induced cachexia. In addition, the correlation with the degree of weight loss and prediction of cachexia in PC patients implicated their potential utility in the diagnosis of PC-induced cachexia.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'INTRODUCTION: Most patients with pancreatic cancer present with advanced stage, incurable disease. However, patients with high-grade precancerous lesions and many patients with low-stage disease can be cured with surgery, suggesting that early detection has the potential to improve survival. While serum CA19.9 has been a long-standing biomarker used for pancreatic cancer disease monitoring, its low sensitivity and poor specificity have driven investigators to hunt for better diagnostic markers. AREAS COVERED: This review will cover recent advances in genetics, proteomics, imaging, and artificial intelligence, which offer opportunities for the early detection of curable pancreatic neoplasms. EXPERT OPINION: From exosomes, to circulating tumor DNA, to subtle changes on imaging, we know much more now about the biology and clinical manifestations of early pancreatic neoplasia than we did just five years ago. The overriding challenge, however, remains the development of a practical approach to screen for a relatively rare, but deadly, disease that is often treated with complex surgery. It is our hope that future advances will bring us closer to an effective and financially sound approach for the early detection of pancreatic cancer and its precursors.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is characterized by a dense desmoplastic stroma that impedes drug delivery, reduces parenchymal blood flow, and suppresses the anti-tumor immune response. The extracellular matrix and abundance of stromal cells result in severe hypoxia within the tumor microenvironment (TME), and emerging publications evaluating PDAC tumorigenesis have shown the adenosine signaling pathway promotes an immunosuppressive TME and contributes to the overall low survival rate. Hypoxia increases many elements of the adenosine signaling pathway, resulting in higher adenosine levels in the TME, further contributing to immune suppression. Extracellular adenosine signals through 4 adenosine receptors (Adora1, Adora2a, Adora2b, Adora3). Of the 4 receptors, Adora2b has the lowest affinity for adenosine and thus, has important consequences when stimulated by adenosine binding in the hypoxic TME. We and others have shown that Adora2b is present in normal pancreas tissue, and in injured or diseased pancreatic tissue, Adora2b levels are significantly elevated. The Adora2b receptor is present on many immune cells, including macrophages, dendritic cells, natural killer cells, natural killer T cells, gammadelta T cells, B cells, T cells, CD4(+) T cells, and CD8(+) T cells. In these immune cell types, adenosine signaling through Adora2b can reduce the adaptive anti-tumor response, augmenting immune suppression, or may contribute to transformation and changes in fibrosis, perineural invasion, or the vasculature by binding the Adora2b receptor on neoplastic epithelial cells, cancer-associated fibroblasts, blood vessels, lymphatic vessels, and nerves. In this review, we discuss the mechanistic consequences of Adora2b activation on cell types in the tumor microenvironment. As the cell-autonomous role of adenosine signaling through Adora2b has not been comprehensively studied in pancreatic cancer cells, we will also discuss published data from other malignancies to infer emerging therapeutic considerations for targeting the Adora2b adenosine receptor to reduce the proliferative, invasive, and metastatic potential of PDAC cells.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D) are associated with increased risk of pancreatic cancer. Here we assessed the relationship between pancreatic cancer and two distinct measures of obesity, namely total adiposity, using BMI, versus abdominal adiposity, using BMI adjusted waist-to-hip ratio (WHRadjBMI) by utilising polygenic scores (PGS) and Mendelian randomisation (MR) analyses. We constructed z-score weighted PGS for BMI and WHRadjBMI using publicly available data and tested for their association with pancreatic cancer defined in UK biobank (UKBB). Using publicly available summary statistics, we then performed bi-directional MR analyses between the two obesity traits and pancreatic cancer. PGS(BMI) was significantly (multiple testing-corrected) associated with pancreatic cancer (OR[95%CI] = 1.0804[1.025-1.14], P = 0.0037). The significance of association declined after T2D adjustment (OR[95%CI] = 1.073[1.018-1.13], P = 0.00904). PGS(WHRadjBMI) association with pancreatic cancer was at the margin of statistical significance (OR[95%CI] = 1.047[0.99-1.104], P = 0.086). T2D adjustment effectively lost any suggestive association of PGS(WHRadjBMI) with pancreatic cancer (OR[95%CI] = 1.039[0.99-1.097], P = 0.14). MR analyses showed a nominally significant causal effect of WHRadjBMI on pancreatic cancer (OR[95%CI] = 1.00095[1.00011-1.0018], P = 0.027) but not for BMI on pancreatic cancer. Overall, we show that abdominal adiposity measured using WHRadjBMI, may be a more important causal risk factor for pancreatic cancer compared to total adiposity, with T2D being a potential driver of this relationship.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: At diagnosis, more than 80% of patients with pancreatic cancer (PC) suffer from significant weight loss due to malnutrition which is a major concern for patient management, and this may negatively impact treatment outcomes and patient prognosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed an observational, retrospective study on patients with metastatic PC (mPC) undergoing first-line chemotherapy with nab-Paclitaxel containing schedules and receiving or not receiving nutritional support (NS) and pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) to investigate their relevance in this setting. RESULTS: We observed that PERT and ancillary dietary interventions are related to longer overall survival (OS; median: 16.5 vs. 7.5 months, P < .001) and have a significant, independent, prognostic impact for better outcomes (P = .013), independently from the therapeutic regimen. Furthermore, PERT and NS prevented weight loss during chemotherapy and obtained an improvement of nutritional parameters such as phase angle and free-fat mass index, after 3 months of anticancer treatment. Consistently, the positive impact on OS correlated also with the prevention of Karnofsky performance status deterioration and a lower incidence of maldigestion-related symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that an early and well-conducted NS in patients with mPC may impact on survival and preserve performance status, thus improving quality of life.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Pancreatic cancer (PC) is the most hypoxic cancer type among solid tumors. The dynamic changes of RNA N6-methyl-adenosine (m6A) contribute to tumor cells adaption to hypoxic microenvironmental. However, the regulatory mechanisms of hypoxia response in PC remains elusive. Here, we reported that the m6A demethylase ALKBH5 mediated a decrease of total mRNA m6A modification during hypoxia. Subsequently, methylated RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeRIP-seq) combined with RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) revealed transcriptome-wide gene expression alteration and identified histone deacetylase type 4 (HDAC4) as a key target gene of m6A modification under hypoxic conditionds. Mechanistically, m6A methylation recognized by m6A reader-YTHDF2 enhanced the stability of HDAC4, and then promoted glycolytic metabolism and migration of PC cells. Our assays also demonstrated that hypoxia-induced HDAC4 enhanced HIF1a protein stability, and overexpressed HIF1a promoted transcription of ALKBH5 in hypoxic pancreatic cancer cells. Together, these results found a ALKBH5/HDAC4/HIF1alpha positive feedback loop for cellular response to hypoxia in pancreatic cancer. Our studies uncover the crosstalk between histone acetylation and RNA methylation modification on layer of epigenetic regulation.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'PURPOSE: Despite the benefits of palliative care (PC) in pancreatic cancer, little is known about patients who access PC. This observational study examines the characteristics of patients with pancreatic cancer at their first episode of PC. METHODS: First-time, specialist PC episodes captured through the Palliative Care Outcomes Collaboration (PCOC), in Victoria, Australia between 2014 and 2020, for pancreatic cancer, were identified. Multivariable logistic regression analyses examined the impact of patient- and service-level characteristics on symptom burden (measured through patient-reported outcome measures and clinician-rated scores) at first PC episode. RESULTS: Of 2890 eligible episodes, 45% began when the patient was deteriorating and 32% ended in death. High fatigue and appetite-related distress were most common. Generally, increasing age, higher performance status and more recent year of diagnosis predicted lower symptom burden. No significant differences were noted between symptom burden of regional/remote versus major city dwellers; however, only 11% of episodes recorded the patient as a regional/remote resident. A greater proportion of first episodes for non-English-speaking patients began when the patient was unstable, deteriorating or terminal, ended in death and were more likely to be associated with high family/carer problems. Community PC setting predicted high symptom burden, with the exception of pain. CONCLUSION: A large proportion of first-time specialist PC episodes in pancreatic cancer begin at a deteriorating phase and end in death, suggesting late access to PC. Timely referrals to community-based specialist PC, access in regional/remote areas, as well as development of culturally diverse support systems require further investigation.',\n",

We investigate recent medication changes and PDAC diagnosis in Nurses' Health Study (NHS; females) and Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS; males), including up to 148,973 U.S. participants followed for 2,994,057 person-years and 991 incident PDAC cases. Here we show recent initiation of antidiabetic (NHS) or anticoagulant (NHS, HFS) medications and cessation of antihypertensive medications (NHS, HPFS) are associated with pancreatic cancer diagnosis in the next 2 years. Two-year PDAC risk increases as number of relevant medication changes increases (P-trend <1 x 10(-5)), with participants who recently start antidiabetic and stop antihypertensive medications having multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio of 4.86 (95%CI, 1.74-13.6). These changes are not associated with diagnosis of other digestive system cancers. Recent medication changes should be considered as candidate features in multi-factor risk models for PDAC, though they are not causally implicated in development of PDAC.\",\n",

       "  'AB': 'OBJECTIVE: Pancreatic cancer is a globally frequent cause of death, which can be caused by many factors. This meta-analysis was performed to assess the correlation between pancreatic cancer and metabolic syndrome (MetS). METHODS: Publications were identified by searching PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library for studies published until November 2022. Case-control and cohort studies published in English that provided information on the odds ratio (OR), relative risk (RR), or hazard ratio (HR) of metabolic syndrome and pancreatic cancer were included in the meta-analysis. Two researchers separately retrieved the core data from the included Random effects meta-analysis was conducted to summarize the findings. Results were presented as relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: MetS showed a strong association with an increased risk of developing pancreatic cancer (RR1.34, 95% CI1.23-1.46, P<0.001), and gender differences were also observed (men: RR 1.26, 95% CI 1.03-1.54, P=0.022; women: RR 1.64, 95% CI 1.41-1.90, P< 0.001). Moreover, an increased risk of developing pancreatic cancer was strongly linked to hypertension, poor high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and hyperglycemia (hypertension: RR 1.10 CI 1.01-1.19, P=0.027; low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol: RR 1.24 CI 1.11-1.38, P<0.001; hyperglycemia: RR 1.55, CI 1.42-1.70, P< 0.001). However, pancreatic cancer was independent of obesity and hypertriglyceridemia (obesity: RR 1.13 CI 0.96-1.32, P=0.151, hypertriglyceridemia: RR 0.96, CI 0.87-1.07, P=0.486). CONCLUSIONS: Although further prospective studies are required for confirmation, this meta-analysis indicated a strong relationship between MetS and pancreatic cancer. Regardless of gender, a greater risk of pancreatic cancer existed in people with MetS. Patients with MetS were more likely to develop pancreatic cancer, regardless of gender. Hypertension, hyperglycemia, and low HDL-c levels may largely account for this association. Further, the prevalence of pancreatic cancer was independent of obesity and hypertriglyceridemia.

       "  'AB': 'Aims: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDACs) form hypovascular and hypoxic tumors, which are difficult to treat with current chemotherapy regimens. Gemcitabine (GEM) is often used as a first-line treatment for PDACs but has issues with chemoresistance and penetration in the interior of the tumor. Evofosfamide, a hypoxia-activated prodrug, has been shown to be effective in combination with GEM, although the mechanism of each drug on the other has not been established. We used mouse xenografts from two cell lines (MIA Paca-2 and SU.86.86) with different tumor microenvironmental characteristics to probe the action of each drug on the other. Results: GEM treatment enhanced survival times in mice with SU.86.86 leg xenografts (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.35, p = 0.03) but had no effect on MIA Paca-2 mice (HR = 0.91, 95% confidence interval = 0.37-2.25, p = 0.84). Conversely, evofosfamide did not improve survival times in SU.86.86 mice to a statistically significant degree (HR = 0.57, p = 0.22). Electron paramagnetic resonance imaging showed that oxygenation worsened in MIA Paca-2 tumors when treated with GEM, providing a direct mechanism for the activation of the hypoxia-activated prodrug evofosfamide by GEM. Sublethal amounts of either treatment enhanced the toxicity of other treatment in vitro in SU.86.86 but not in MIA Paca-2. By the biomarker gammaH2AX, combination treatment increased the number of double-stranded DNA lesions in vitro for SU.86.86 but not MIA Paca-2. Innovation and Conclusion: The synergy between GEM and evofosfamide appears to stem from the dual action of GEMs effect on tumor vasculature and inhibition by GEM of the homologous recombination DNA repair process.

       "  'AB': 'Pancreatic cancer (PC) has a low incidence rate but a high mortality, with patients often in the advanced stage of the disease at the time of the first diagnosis. If detected, early neoplastic lesions are ideal for surgery, offering the best prognosis. Preneoplastic lesions of the pancreas include pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia and mucinous cystic neoplasms, with intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms being the most commonly diagnosed. Our study focused on predicting PC by identifying early signs using noninvasive techniques and artificial intelligence (AI). A systematic English literature search was conducted on the PubMed electronic database and other sources. We obtained a total of 97 studies on the subject of pancreatic neoplasms. The final number of articles included in our study was 44, 34 of which focused on the use of AI algorithms in the early diagnosis and prediction of pancreatic lesions. AI algorithms can facilitate diagnosis by analyzing massive amounts of data in a short period of time. Correlations can be made through AI algorithms by expanding image and electronic medical records databases, which can later be used as part of a screening program for the general population. AI-based screening models should involve a combination of biomarkers and medical and imaging data from different sources. This requires large numbers of resources, collaboration between medical practitioners, and investment in medical infrastructures.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'PURPOSE: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains a common and difficult cancer to treat. Surgical resection and chemotherapy are standard of care and clinical outcomes remain poor. Oncolytic adenoviruses are a unique approach to the treatment of this challenging cancer, aiming to overcome the features of this disease that pose the key obstacles to standard therapies. This paper provides a detailed review of the clinical trials of conditionally-replicative adenoviruses in pancreatic cancer to date, with a brief summary of the past preclinical literature and future prospects of this therapy. METHODS: MEDLINE, Embase, and clinicaltrials.gov were searched from inception to December 23rd 2022 for clinical trials of conditionally-replicative adenoviruses used in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Primary features for review included patient demographics, treatment protocol including dose and administration route, adverse events, patient responses and survival rates. RESULTS: The six published clinical trials suggest that objective clinical responses can be achieved with a tolerable level of side effects, even at high viral doses. The more clinically adaptable intravenous route of administration also appears to be as well tolerated as the more challenging intratumoural injections. CONCLUSION: Published clinical trials provide data of the safety and some signs of oncolytic activity of conditionally-replicative adenoviruses in patients with pancreatic cancer. Importantly, on the latest trials, the easier intravenous route of administration seems to be well tolerated and safe, providing the opportunity for further clinical evaluation. It is hoped that the ongoing clinical trials will yield more promising results of this therapeutic approach against a currently intractable disease.',\n",

       "  'AB': \"BACKGROUND: Cancer cachexia is a multifactorial syndrome characterized by body weight loss and systemic inflammation. The characterization of the inflammatory response in patients with cachexia is still limited. Lipocalin-2, a protein abundant in neutrophils, has recently been implicated in appetite suppression in preclinical models of pancreatic cancer cachexia. We hypothesized that lipocalin-2 levels could be associated with neutrophil activation and nutritional status of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients. METHODS: Plasma levels of neutrophil activation markers calprotectin, myeloperoxidase, elastase, and bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein (BPI) were compared between non-cachectic PDAC patients (n=13) and cachectic PDAC patients with high (>/=26.9 ng/mL, n=34) or low (<26.9 ng/mL, n=34) circulating lipocalin-2 levels. Patients' nutritional status was assessed by the patient-generated subjective global assessment (PG-SGA) and through body composition analysis using CT-scan slices at the L3 level. RESULTS: Circulating lipocalin-2 levels did not differ between cachectic and non-cachectic PDAC patients (median 26.7 (IQR 19.7-34.8) vs. 24.8 (16.6-29.4) ng/mL, p=0.141). Cachectic patients with high systemic lipocalin-2 levels had higher concentrations of calprotectin, myeloperoxidase, and elastase than non-cachectic patients or cachectic patients with low lipocalin-2 levels (calprotectin: 542.3 (355.8-724.9) vs. 457.5 (213.3-606.9), p=0.448 vs. 366.5 (294.5-478.5) ng/mL, p=0.009; myeloperoxidase: 30.3 (22.1-37.9) vs. 16.3 (12.0-27.5), p=0.021 vs. 20.2 (15.0-29.2) ng/mL, p=0.011; elastase: 137.1 (90.8-253.2) vs. 97.2 (28.8-215.7), p=0.410 vs. 95.0 (72.2-113.6) ng/mL, p=0.006; respectively). The CRP/albumin ratio was also higher in cachectic patients with high lipocalin-2 levels (2.3 (1.3-6.0) as compared to non-cachectic patients (1.0 (0.7-4.2), p=0.041). Lipocalin-2 concentrations correlated with those of calprotectin (r(s) =0.36, p<0.001), myeloperoxidase (r(s) =0.48, p<0.001), elastase (r(s) =0.50, p<0.001), and BPI (r(s) =0.22, p=0.048). Whereas no significant correlations with weight loss, BMI, or L3 skeletal muscle index were observed, lipocalin-2 concentrations were associated with subcutaneous adipose tissue index (r(s) =-0.25, p=0.034). Moreover, lipocalin-2 tended to be elevated in severely malnourished patients compared with well-nourished patients (27.2 (20.3-37.2) vs. 19.9 (13.4-26.4) ng/mL, p=0.058). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that lipocalin-2 levels are associated with neutrophil activation in patients with pancreatic cancer cachexia and that it may contribute to their poor nutritional status.\",\n",

       "  'AB': 'Background and Objectives: Opioid analgesics, which are used for cancer-related pain management, cause opioid-induced constipation (OIC). Naldemedine, a peripheral opioid receptor antagonist, is an OIC-modifying agent, but no focused efficacy and safety analysis has been conducted for its use in hepatobiliary pancreatic cancers. We performed a multi-institutional study on the efficacy and safety of naldemedine in patients with hepatobiliary pancreatic cancer using opioids in clinical practice. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively evaluated patients with hepatobiliary pancreatic cancer (including liver, biliary tract, and pancreatic cancers) treated with opioids and naldemedine during hospitalization at ten institutions in Japan from June 2017 to August 2019. We assessed the frequency of bowel movements before and after the initiation of naldemedine therapy. Responders were defined as patients who defecated >/=3 times/week, with an increase from a baseline of >/=1 defecations/week over seven days after the initiation of naldemedine administration. Results: Thirty-four patients were observed for one week before and one week after starting naldemedine. The frequency of bowel movements increased by one over the baseline frequency or to at least thrice per week in 21 patients. The response rate was 61.7% (95% confidence interval: 45.4-78.0%). The median number of weekly bowel movements before and after naldemedine treatment was 2 (range: 0-9) and 6 (range: 1-17), respectively, in the overall population (n = 34); the increase in the number of bowel movements following naldemedine administration was statistically significant (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, p < 0.0001). Diarrhea was the predominant gastrointestinal symptom, and 10 (29.4%) patients experienced grade 1, grade 2, or grade 3 adverse events. The only other adverse event included fatigue in one patient; grade 2-4 adverse events were absent. Conclusions: Naldemedine is effective, and its use may be safe in clinical practice for patients with hepatobiliary pancreatic cancer receiving opioid analgesics.',\n",

       "  'AB': \"Pancreatic cancer remains one of the deadliest cancer types. It is usually characterized by high resistance to chemotherapy. However, cancer-targeted drugs, such as sunitinib, recently have shown beneficial effects in pancreatic in vitro and in vivo models. Therefore, we chose to study a series of sunitinib derivatives developed by us, that were proven to be promising compounds for cancer treatment. The aim of our research was to evaluate the anticancer activity of sunitinib derivatives in human pancreatic cancer cell lines MIA PaCa-2 and PANC-1 under normoxia and hypoxia. The effect on cell viability was determined by the MTT assay. The compound effect on cell colony formation and growth was established by clonogenic assay and the activity on cell migration was estimated using a 'wound healing' assay. Six out of 17 tested compounds at 1 microM after 72 h of incubation reduced cell viability by 90% and were more active than sunitinib. Compounds for more detailed experiments were chosen based on their activity and selectivity towards cancer cells compared to fibroblasts. The most promising compound EMAC4001 was 24 and 35 times more active than sunitinib against MIA PaCa-2 cells, and 36 to 47 times more active against the PANC-1 cell line in normoxia and hypoxia. It also inhibited MIA PaCa-2 and PANC-1 cell colony formation. Four tested compounds inhibited MIA PaCa-2 and PANC-1 cell migration under hypoxia, but none was more active than sunitinib. In conclusion, sunitinib derivatives possess anticancer activity in human pancreatic adenocarcinoma MIA PaCa-2 and PANC-1 cell lines, and they are promising for further research.\",\n",

An early and appropriate nutritional intervention is mandatory to improve the outcome of patients with pancreatic cancer at any stage of disease.

       "  'AB': 'PURPOSE: Patients with pancreatic cancer often have cancer cachexia at diagnosis. Recent studies suggested that loss of skeletal muscle mass was related to cancer cachexia, which hindered continuance of chemotherapy and could be one of prognostic factors in pancreatic cancer, however the association remains unclear in patients receiving gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel (GnP). METHODS: We retrospectively studied 138 patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer receiving first-line GnP at the University of Tokyo from January 2015 to September 2020. We calculated body composition in CT images before chemotherapy and at initial evaluation, and evaluated the association of both body composition before chemotherapy and its changes at initial evaluation. RESULTS: Compared by skeletal muscle mass index (SMI) change rate between pre-chemotherapy and initial evaluation, there were statistically significantly differences in the median OS: 16.3 months (95%CI 12.3-22.7) and 10.3 months (95%CI 8.3-18.1) between SMI change rate >/= -3.5% and < -3.5% groups (P = 0.01). By multivariate analysis for OS, CA19-9 (HR 3.34, 95%CI 2.00-5.57, P < 0.01), PLR (HR 1.68, 95%CI 1.01-2.78, P = 0.04), mGPS (HR 2.32, 95%CI 1.47-3.65, P < 0.01) and relative dose intensity (HR 2.21, 95%CI 1.42-3.46, P < 0.01) were significantly poor prognostic factors. SMI change rate (HR 1.47, 95%CI 0.95-2.28, P = 0.08) showed a trend to poor prognosis. Sarcopenia before chemotherapy was not significantly associated with PFS or OS. CONCLUSION: Early skeletal muscle mass decline was associated with poor OS. Further investigation is warranted whether the maintenance of skeletal muscle mass by nutritional support would improve prognosis.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Introduction. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is associated with poor prognosis and 98% loss-of-life expectancy. 80% of patients with PDA are unfit for radical surgery. In those cases, emphasis is set on management of cancer-related symptoms, among which obstructive jaundice is most common. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided biliary drainage (EUS-BD) emerges as a valid alternative to the well-accepted methods for treatment of biliary obstruction. Patient Selection. Five consecutive patients with unresectable pancreatic malignancy, were subjected to EUS-BD, particularly EUS-guided choledochoduodenostomy (EUS-CDS). Ethics. Oral and written informed consent was obtained in all cases prior procedure. Technique. EUS-guided puncture of the common bile duct was performed, followed by advancement of a guidewire to the intrahepatic bile ducts. After dilation of the fistulous tract with a cystotome, a fully covered self-expandable metal stent was inserted below the hepatic confluence and extending at least 3 cm in the duodenum. Technical and clinical success was achieved in four patients without adverse events. In one patient procedure failed due to dislocation of the guidewire, with consequent biliary leakage requiring urgent surgery. Recovery was uneventful with no further clinical sequelae and there was no mortality associated with procedure. Discussion. Introduced in 2001, EUS-guided biliary drainage has become an accepted option for treatment of obstructive jaundice. According to recent guidelines published by European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) in 2022, EUS-CDS is a preferred modality to percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD) and surgery in patients with failed ERCP, with comparable efficiency and better safety profile, which is supported by our experience with the procedure. Conclusions. Our case series suggests that EUS-CDS is an excellent option for palliative management of malignant distal biliary obstruction, emphasizes on the importance of adequate technique and experience for the technical success, and urges the need for future research on establishing the best choice for guidewire and dilation device.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Fluorouracil, leucovorin (5FU/LV), and nanoliposomal-irinotecan (nal-IRI) combination therapy has been established as the second-line treatment for advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Oxaliplatin with 5FU/LV (FOLFOX) is often used as a subsequent treatment, although its efficacy and safety are yet to be fully elucidated. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of FOLFOX as a third- or later-line treatment for patients with advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. METHODS: We conducted a single-centre, retrospective study that enrolled 43 patients who received FOLFOX after failure of gemcitabine-based regimen followed by 5FU/LV + nal-IRI therapy between October 2020 and January 2022. FOLFOX therapy consisted of oxaliplatin (85 mg/m(2)), levo-leucovorin calcium (200 mg/m(2)) and 5-FU (2400 mg/m(2)) every 2 weeks per cycle. Overall survival, progression-free survival, objective response, and adverse events were evaluated. RESULTS: At the median follow-up time of 3.9 months in all patients, the median overall survival and progression-free survival were 3.9 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.1-4.8) and 1.3 months (95% CI, 1.0-1.5), respectively. Response and disease control rates were 0 and 25.6%, respectively. The most common adverse event was anaemia in all grades followed by anorexia; the incidence of anorexia and grades 3 and 4 was 21 and 4.7%, respectively. Notably, grades 3-4 peripheral sensory neuropathy was not observed. Multivariable analysis revealed that a C-reactive protein (CRP) level of > 1.0 mg/dL was a poor prognostic factor for both progression-free survival and overall survival: hazard ratios were 2.037 (95% CI, 1.010-4.107; p = 0.047) and 2.471 (95% CI, 1.063-5.745; p = 0.036), respectively. CONCLUSION: FOLFOX as a subsequent treatment after failure of second-line treatment with 5FU/LV + nal-IRI is tolerable, although its efficacy is limited, particularly in patients with high CRP levels.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: In preclinical pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) models, inhibition of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) signaling using ficlatuzumab, a recombinant humanized anti-HGF antibody, and gemcitabine reduced tumor burden. METHODS: Patients with previously untreated metastatic PDAC enrolled in a phase Ib dose escalation study with 3 + 3 design of 2 dose cohorts of ficlatuzumab 10 and 20 mg/kg administered intravenously every other week with gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 and albumin-bound paclitaxel 125 mg/m2 given 3 weeks on and 1 week off. This was followed by an expansion phase at the maximally tolerated dose of the combination. RESULTS: Twenty-six patients (sex, 12 male:14 female; median age, 68 years [range, 49-83 years]) were enrolled, 22 patients were evaluable. No dose-limiting toxicities were identified (N = 7 pts) and ficlatuzumab at 20 mg/kg was chosen as the maximum tolerated dose. Among the 21 patients treated at the MTD, best response by RECISTv1.1: 6 (29%) partial response, 12 (57%) stable disease, 1 (5%) progressive disease, and 2 (9%) not evaluable. Median progression-free survival and overall survival times were 11.0 months (95% CI, 7.6-11.4 months) and 16.2 months (95% CI, 9.1 months to not reached), respectively. Toxicities attributed to ficlatuzumab included hypoalbuminemia (grade 3, 16%; any grade, 52%) and edema (grade 3, 8%; any grade, 48%). Immunohistochemistry for c-Met pathway activation demonstrated higher tumor cell p-Met levels in patients who experienced response to therapy. CONCLUSION: In this phase Ib trial, ficlatuzumab, gemcitabine, and albumin-bound paclitaxel were associated with durable treatment responses and increased rates of hypoalbuminemia and edema.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to describe symptom clusters (SCs), and symptom experiences in early postoperative patients with pancreatic cancer who are recovering at home. METHODS: From October 2021 and April 2022,15 patients following pancreatic cancer surgery were recruited from a tertiary hospital in Jiangsu Province by maximum variation sampling. Semi-structured interviews were performed to collect data and thematic analysis was conducted to analyze the data. RESULTS: Three themes were extracted from the data. The first theme \"difference in symptom perception and cognition\" illustrated factors such as patient knowledge, expected recovery status, and risk perception could influence patient symptom experience. Most patients actually reported fewer and less severe symptoms than previous studies. The second theme \"the results of symptom cluster\" demonstrated anorexia-distress SC, bowel-digestive related SC and sleep disturbance related SC, and anorexia-distress SC should be considered as the priority SC given its multidimensional significance for patients. The last theme described the patient\\'s positive attitudes, behaviours and barriers to coping with symptoms, namely \"symptom self-management experience\". CONCLUSION: There are differences in the perception and interpretation of SCs in postoperative pancreatic cancer patients. Understanding the meaning of individual differences in the experience of symptoms can assist patients in the management of SCs. Medical staff should combine patient self-management strategies and evidence-based data to provide appropriate support at different stages to improve patient symptom management and quality of life.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Extensive desmoplasia and poor vasculature renders pancreatic tumors severely hypoxic, contributing to their aggressiveness and therapy resistance. Here, we identify the HuR/MYB/HIF1alpha axis as a critical regulator of the metabolic plasticity and hypoxic survival of pancreatic cancer cells. HuR undergoes nuclear-to-cytoplasmic translocation under hypoxia and stabilizes MYB transcripts, while MYB transcriptionally upregulates HIF1alpha. Upon MYB silencing, pancreatic cancer cells fail to survive and adapt metabolically under hypoxia, despite forced overexpression of HIF1alpha. MYB induces the transcription of several HIF1alpha-regulated glycolytic genes by directly binding to their promoters, thus enhancing the recruitment of HIF1alpha to hypoxia-responsive elements through its interaction with p300-dependent histone acetylation. MYB-depleted pancreatic cancer cells exhibit a dramatic reduction in tumorigenic ability, glucose-uptake and metabolism in orthotopic mouse model, even after HIF1alpha restoration. Together, our findings reveal an essential role of MYB in metabolic reprogramming that supports pancreatic cancer cell survival under hypoxia.',\n",

In current circumstances, targeting individuals with a high risk of pancreatic cancer may be more rational. Several screening modalities for pancreatic cancer have also become debatable topics.

       "  'AB': 'Pancreatic cancer has the highest mortality rate of all major cancers, with a 5-year survival rate of about 10%. Early warning signs and symptoms of pancreatic cancer are vague or nonexistent, and most patients are diagnosed in Stage IV, when surgery is not an option for about 80%-85% of patients. For patients with inoperable pancreatic cancer, current conventional treatment modalities such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy (RT) have suboptimal efficacy. Tumor progression is closely associated with the tumor microenvironment, which includes peripheral blood vessels, bone marrow-derived inflammatory cells, fibroblasts, immune cells, signaling molecules, and extracellular matrix. Tumor cells affect the microenvironment by releasing extracellular signaling molecules, inducing peripheral immune tolerance, and promoting tumor angiogenesis. In turn, the immune cells of the tumor affect the survival and proliferation of cancer cells. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells are key cellular components in the tumor microenvironment and exert immunosuppressive functions by producing cytokines, recognizing other immune cells, and promoting tumor growth and metastasis. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells are the main regulator of the tumor immune response and a key target for tumor treatments. Since the combination of RT and immunotherapy is the main strategy for the treatment of pancreatic cancer, it is very important to understand the immune mechanisms which lead to MDSCs generation and the failure of current therapies in order to develop new target-based therapies. This review summarizes the research advances on the role of Myeloid-derived suppressor cells in the progression of pancreatic cancer and its treatment application in recent years.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Sarcopenia is defined as skeletal muscle loss and can be assessed by cross-sectional imaging. Our aim was to establish the effect of sarcopenia on relevant outcomes in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) in curative and palliative settings based on a large patient sample. MATERIALS AND METHODS: MEDLINE library, EMBASE and SCOPUS databases were screened for the associations between sarcopenia and mortality in patients with PDAC up to March 2022. The primary endpoint of the systematic review was the hazard ratio of Sarcopenia on survival. 22 studies were included into the present analysis. RESULTS: The included 22 studies comprised 3958 patients. The prevalence of sarcopenia was 38.7%. Sarcopenia was associated with a higher prevalence in the palliative setting (OR 53.23, CI 39.00-67.45, p<0.001) compared to the curative setting (OR 36.73, CI 27.81-45.65, p<0.001). Sarcopenia was associated with worse OS in the univariable (HR 1.79, CI 1.41-2.28, p<0.001) and multivariable analysis (HR 1.62, CI 1.27-2.07, p<0.001) in the curative setting. For the palliative setting the pooled hazards ratio showed that sarcopenia was associated with overall survival (HR 1.56, CI 1.21-2.02, p<0.001) as well as in multivariable analysis (HR 1.77, CI 1.39-2.26, p<0.001). Sarcopenia was not associated with a higher rate of post-operative complications in univariable analysis (OR 1.10, CI 0.70-1.72, p = 0.69). CONCLUSION: Sarcopenia occurs in 38.7% of patients with pancreatic cancer, significantly more in the palliative setting. Sarcopenia is associated with overall survival in both settings. The assessment of sarcopenia is therefore relevant for personalized oncology. Sarcopenia is not associated with postoperative complications.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Pancreatic cancer is a highly lethal disease associated with significant morbidity and mortality. In the United States (US), the overall 5-year relative survival rate for pancreatic cancer during the 2012-2018 period was 11.5%. However, the cancer stage at diagnosis strongly influences relative survival in these patients. Per the National Cancer Institute (NCI) statistics for 2012-2018, the 5-year relative survival rate for patients with localized disease was 43.9%, while it was 3.1% for patients with distant metastasis. The poor survival rates are primarily due to the late development of clinical signs and symptoms. Hence, early diagnosis is critical in improving treatment outcomes. In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has gained immense popularity in gastroenterology. AI-assisted endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) models have been touted as a breakthrough in the early detection of pancreatic cancer. These models may also accurately differentiate pancreatic cancer from chronic pancreatitis and autoimmune pancreatitis, which mimics pancreatic cancer on radiological imaging. In this review, we detail the application of AI-assisted EUS models for pancreatic cancer detection. We also highlight the utility of AI-assisted EUS models in differentiating pancreatic cancer from radiological mimickers. Furthermore, we discuss the current limitations and future applications of AI technology in EUS for pancreatic cancers.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of static magnetic field (SMF) presence on the radiation response of pancreatic cancer cells in polyurethane-based highly macro-porous scaffolds in hypoxic (1% O(2)) and normoxic (21% O(2)) conditions, towards understanding MR-guided radiotherapy, shedding light on the potential interaction phenomenon between SMF and radiation in a three-dimensional (3D) microenvironment. METHODS: Pancreatic cancer cells (PANC-1, ASPC-1) were seeded into fibronectin-coated highly porous polyethene scaffolds for biomimicry and cultured for 4 weeks in in vitro normoxia (21% O(2)) followed by a 2-day exposure to either in vitro hypoxia (1% O(2)) or maintenance in in vitro normoxia (21% O(2)). The samples were then irradiated with 6 MV photons in the presence or absence of a 1.5 T field. Thereafter, in situ post-radiation monitoring (1 and 7 days post-irradiation treatment) took place via quantification of (i) live dead and (ii) apoptotic profiles. RESULTS: We report: (i) pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma hypoxia-associated radioprotection, in line with our previous findings, (ii) an enhanced effect of radiation in the presence of SMFin in vitro hypoxia (1% O(2)) for both short- (1 day) and long-term (7 days) post -radiation analysis and (iii) an enhanced effect of radiation in the presence of SMF in in vitro normoxia (21% O(2)) for long-term (7 days) post-radiation analysis within a 3D pancreatic cancer model. CONCLUSION: With limited understanding of the potential interaction phenomenon between SMF and radiation, this 3D system allows combination evaluation for a cancer in which the role of radiotherapy is still evolving. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: This study examined the use of a 3D model to investigate MR-guided radiotherapy in a hypoxic microenvironment, indicating that this could be a useful platform to further understanding of SMF influence on radiation.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Objective Anamorelin, a novel selective ghrelin receptor agonist, was approved in Japan for the treatment of cachexia in pancreatic cancer (PC), albeit with limited evidence. This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of anamorelin in PC and examined the impact of the extent of weight loss on the efficacy of anamorelin. Methods We retrospectively investigated consecutive PC patients with cachexia who received anamorelin at our institution between June 2021 and January 2022. Patients were divided into two groups: moderate-weight-loss group (5-10%) and severe-weight-loss group (>10%). The primary outcome was changes in body weight. The secondary outcomes were changes in appetite and laboratory measures as well as treatment-related severe adverse events. Results A total of 24 patients were included (moderate/severe weight loss: 8/16). The moderate-weight-loss group showed significantly more weight gain than the severe-weight-loss group. Improvements in appetite were consistently observed in each weight-loss group. Changes in laboratory markers were not significantly different between groups. Hyperglycemia (four patients) was the most common cause of severe adverse events, followed by abdominal distension, nausea, elevated liver function tests, and bulimia. Conclusion The efficacy of anamorelin was associated with the extent of weight loss. Although anamorelin improved appetite in each weight-loss group, it increased body weight only in the moderate-weight-loss group. Anamorelin was well-tolerated among advanced PC patients, although caution must be practiced when it is used in patients with concomitant diabetes mellitus.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most aggressive and difficult to treat cancers with tumors typically exhibiting high levels of chronic hypoxia. Hypoxia activates hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) that mediate cellular responses to adapt to low oxygen environments. Hypoxia also causes endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, increasing activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), a master regulator of the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway that mediates cellular response to ER stress. ATF4 is overexpressed in PDAC and is associated with poor prognoses. While ATF4 promotes cell proliferation and tumorigenesis, most studies have been conducted under normoxia or acute hypoxia. The functions of ATF4 in chronic hypoxia remain largely unexplored. Using siRNA knockdown experiments of healthy skin fibroblast cells WS1 and PDAC cell lines PANC-1 and Mia-PaCa2 to analyze mRNA and protein expression levels, a novel ATF4 function was identified, in which it decreases HIF2alpha mRNA and increases HIF1alpha mRNA in chronic hypoxia while having no effect in acute hypoxia. A scratch assay was used to show that ATF4 decreases cell migration in chronic hypoxia as opposed to the increase in cell migration ATF4 imparts in acute hypoxia. Colony formation assay and cell viability assay showed that ATF4 promotes colony formation and cell viability in both chronic and acute hypoxia. In addition to the differential response of ATF4 in chronic hypoxia compared with acute hypoxia, this is the first time ATF4 has been implicated in regulation of response to hypoxia via interaction with HIF proteins in PDAC.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Nanoliposomal irinotecan (nal-IRI) was recently authorized in Japan for unresectable pancreatic cancer after disease progression following chemotherapy. Physicians now consider certain aspects of nal-IRI safety profile as slightly different from conventional irinotecan. This report aims to explore additional aspects of the nal-IRI safety in Japanese phase 2 study. METHODS: We analyzed the incidence, time to first onset, and time to resolution for adverse events that require special attention and other selected toxicities in the nal-IRI combination group (n = 46). RESULTS: Leukopenia/neutropenia (76.1%/71.7%), diarrhea (58.7%) and hepatic dysfunction (41.3%) were the most commonly reported treatment-emergent adverse events, with a median time to onset of 21.0 days (range: 8, 97), 9.0 days (1, 61) and 22.0 days (2, 325), respectively, and a median time to resolution of 8.0 days (95% confidence intervals: 8, 9), 4.0 days (4, 8) and 40.0 days (9, -), respectively. Eight patients experienced Grade >/= 3 diarrhea and their symptoms were well controlled by dose modification except one patient who had drug withdrawal. The median time to resolution for Grade >/= 3 and Grade </= 2 diarrhea was 17.5 days (95% confidence intervals: 1, 31) and 4 days (3, 7), respectively. Anorexia occurred in 28/46 patients (60.9%) with a median time to onset of 4.0 days (range: 2, 132) and a median time to resolution of 12.0 days (95% confidence intervals: 6, 26). CONCLUSIONS: We explored safety profile of nal-IRI combination regimen recognized as effective and tolerable treatment for Japanese unresectable pancreatic cancer patients. Although the treatment-emergent adverse events occurred were controllable, patients with prolonged toxicities should be closely managed.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP) and pancreatic cancer (PC) are two different diseases. Their diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis are different, and it is difficult to differentiate them. This study aimed to explore the role of steroid treatment response combined with serological mark in distinguishing type-1 AIP from PC. Clinical data were collected and compared from 50 cases of AIP (group 1) and 100 cases of PC (group 2). The diagnostic value of serum IgG4, CA19-9, globulin, and eosinophil cell (EC) were evaluated. The response of steroid treatment of 28 patients with atypical imaging in group 1 was analyzed. After 2 weeks, the patients were classified as positive and negative steroid response according to the manifestations and/or the radiological changes. The positive response cases (n = 20) were confirmed as AIP, whereas negative ones (n = 8) were finally diagnosed as PC after complete resection. Serum globulin, IgG4, and EC levels in group 1 were significantly higher than those in group 2 (P < .01), and CA19-9 levels were distinctly lower in group 1 (P < .01). The level of serum IgG4 was related to the accuracy of diagnosis of AIP on the basis of the result of logistic regression analysis. Two-weeks steroid therapy response combined with serum IgG4 levels contribute to the differential diagnosis AIP and PC. However, regular and long-term follow-up were important for the differential diagnosis. There was an urgent need to explore the specific markers that distinguish these 2 entities.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Objective Pseudoaneurysm rupture associated with unresected pancreatic cancer can cause rare but fatal hemobilia and gastrointestinal bleeding. This study aimed to identify factors predicting pseudoaneurysm rupture. Methods We conducted a single-center case-control study of unresected pancreatic cancer patients treated at Shizuoka General Hospital between January 2011 and July 2020 using a retrospective cancer registry database. Included in the study were 611 consecutive patients with unresected pancreatic cancer, of whom 55 developed overt upper gastrointestinal bleeding or hemobilia. Twenty patients were excluded, as they had not undergone contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) or angiography. Patients were classified into pseudoaneurysm and non-pseudoaneurysm groups. One patient with arterial bleeding but without obvious pseudoaneurysm was included in the pseudoaneurysm group. Factors predicting pseudoaneurysm rupture at the onset of overt gastrointestinal bleeding were investigated using a logistic regression analysis. CT findings revealing air bubbles inside the tumor were described as intratumoral air bubbles. Results Thirty-five patients were included (15 in the pseudoaneurysm group, 20 in the non-pseudoaneurysm group). In the multivariate analysis, intratumoral air bubbles [odds ratio (OR), 12.9; 95% confidence interval (CI), 2.14-77.9; p=0.005] and hematemesis (OR, 6.30; 95% CI, 1.03-38.6; p=0.047) were independent predictors of pseudoaneurysm rupture. In addition, patients who experienced successful hemostasis and were re-administered chemotherapy survived more than six months. Conclusion This study reveals that intratumoral air bubbles and hematemesis may predict pseudoaneurysm rupture at the onset of overt gastrointestinal bleeding. For patients presenting these findings, an examination with conventional or CT angiography may lead to an early diagnosis and improve the patient prognosis.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is an essential target for cancer treatment. However, EGFR inhibitor erlotinib showed limited clinical benefit in pancreatic cancer therapy. Here, we showed the underlying mechanism of tumor microenvironment suppressing the sensitivity of EGFR inhibitor through the pancreatic stellate cell (PSC). METHODS: The expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) and hypoxia marker in human pancreatic cancer tissues were detected by immunohistochemistry, and their correlation with overall survival was evaluated. Human immortalized PSC was constructed and used to investigate the potential effect on pancreatic cancer cell lines in hypoxia and normoxia. Luciferase reporter assay and Chromatin immunoprecipitation were performed to explore the potential mechanisms in vitro. The combined inhibition of EGFR and Met was evaluated in an orthotopic xenograft mouse model of pancreatic cancer. FINDINGS: We found that high expression levels of alpha-SMA and hypoxia markers are associated with poor prognosis of pancreatic cancer patients. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that hypoxia induced the expression and secretion of HGF in PSC via transcription factor HIF-1alpha. PSC-derived HGF activates Met, the HGF receptor, suppressing the sensitivity of pancreatic cancer cells to EGFR inhibitor in a KRAS-independent manner by activating the PI3K-AKT pathway. Furthermore, we found that the combination of EGFR inhibitor and Met inhibitor significantly suppressed tumor growth in an orthotopic xenograft mouse model. INTERPRETATION: Our study revealed a previously uncharacterized HIF1alpha-HGF-Met-PI3K-AKT signaling axis between PSC and cancer cells and indicated that EGFR inhibition plus Met inhibition might be a promising strategy for pancreatic cancer treatment.

       "  'AB': 'Pancreatic cancer (PC) is one of the most malignant tumors. Rapid progression and distant metastasis are the main causes of patient death. Hypoxia is a hallmark of multiple cancers and is involved in tumor biology. However, little is known about the roles of circRNAs in glycolysis and hypoxia-mediated progression of PC. Here, the expression pattern of hypoxia-related circRNAs was analyzed using RNA sequencing. A unique circRNA termed circRNF13 was found to be upregulated in PC tissues and may be a potential prognostic indicator. HIF-1alpha and EIF4A3 are involved in regulating the biogenesis of circRNF13. Furthermore, circRNF13 was validated to exert a stimulative effect on cell proliferation, angiogenesis, invasion and glycolysis. Importantly, we found that circRNF13 promoted PDK3 levels by acting as a miR-654-3p sponge, thus promoting the PC malignant process. Collectively, our results reveal that hypoxia-induced circRNF13 mediated by HIF-1alpha and EIF4A3 promotes tumor progression and glycolysis in PC, indicating the potential of circRNF13 as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for PC.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Abnormal lipid metabolism often occurs under hypoxic microenvironment, which is an important energy supplement for cancer cell proliferation and metastasis. We aimed to explore the lipid metabolism characteristics and gene expression features of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) related to hypoxia and identify biomarkers for molecular classification based on hypoxic lipid metabolism that are evaluable for PDAC prognosis and therapy. The multiple datasets were analyzed integratively, including corresponding clinical information of samples. PDAC possesses a distinct metabolic profile and oxygen level compared with normal pancreatic tissues, according to the bioinformatics methods. In addition, a study on untargeted metabolomics using Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography Tandem Mass Spectrometry(UPLC-MS) revealed lipid metabolites differences affected by oxygen. Analysis of PDAC gene expression profiling in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) revealed that the sphingolipid process correlates closely with HIF1alpha. According to the characters of HIF-1 and sphingolipid, samples can be clustered into three subgroups using non-negative matrix factorization clustering. In cluster2, patients had an increased survival time. Relatively high MUC16 mutation arises in cluster2 and may positively influence the cancer survival rates. This study explored the expression pattern of lipid metabolism under hypoxia microenvironment in PDAC. On the basis of metabolic signatures, we identified the prognosis subtypes linking lipid metabolism to hypoxia. The classifications may be conducive to developing personalized treatment programs targeting metabolic profiles.',\n",

       "  'AB': \"Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is a disease with no effective treatment. Chemo-resistance contributes to the dismal prognosis for patients diagnosed with the disease. This study aims to evaluate the toxicity and the effect of Caralluma europaea (C.E) extracts on cancer cell survival, apoptosis, chemo-resistance, and pro-cancer pathways, in pancreatic cancer. The acute and subacute toxicities of C.E extracts were evaluated. The cytotoxic effect on pancreatic cancer cell survival and apoptosis was determined by MTT assay and DNA fragmentation. The expression of cancer stemness markers was measured using Western blot. A molecular docking was used to test the possible effects of C.E compounds in inhibiting the Hedgehog and activating caspase-3. The hydroethanolic extract's DL(50) was over 5000 mg/kg. During the subacute toxicity, only saponins extract showed some hepatic toxicity signs. Cells treated with C.E extracts combined with gemcitabine revealed an additive anti-survival activity. C.E extracts sensitized resistant MIA-PaCa-2 to gemcitabine treatment. Most of the C.E extracts downregulated the expression of cancer stemness-associated genes. Luteolin-7-O-glucoside presented the highest docking Gscore on human Smoothened. Isorhamnetin-3-O-rutinoside induced apoptosis via activation of caspase-3. C.E extracts can be considered safe in inhibiting pancreatic cancer cell survival, inducing apoptosis, and sensitizing cells to chemotherapy via Hedgehog inhibition and caspase-3 activation.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Body mass index (BMI) during adulthood has been associated with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), however, patterns of body size across the adult life course have not been studied extensively. We comprehensively evaluated the association between adiposity across adulthood and PDAC. METHODS: We conducted a prospective analysis of 269 480 (162 735 males, 106 745 females) National Institutes of Health-AARP Diet and Health Study participants, aged 50-71 years (1995-1996) who self-reported height and weight history. Participants were followed through December 31, 2011. We examined associations between BMI (kg/m2) at ages 18, 35, 50, and 50-71 (baseline) years, their trajectories determined from latent-class trajectory modeling, and incident PDAC. Cox proportional hazard models were used to calculate multivariable adjusted hazards ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: During up to 15.2 years of follow-up, 3092 (2020 males, 1072 females) patients with incident PDAC were identified. BMI at all 4 ages were statistically significantly associated with increased PDAC (per 5-unit increase, HR = 1.09-1.13) with higher magnitude associations in males than females at ages 35 years and older (Pinteraction < .05). Four BMI trajectories were created. Compared with normal-weight maintainers, normal-to-overweight, normal-to-obese class I, and overweight-to-obese class III trajectories had hazard ratios of 1.15 (95% CI = 1.06 to 1.25), 1.39 (95% CI = 1.25 to 1.54), and 1.48 (95% CI = 1.18 to 1.87), respectively (Pinteraction by sex = .07). CONCLUSIONS: High BMI and BMI trajectories that result in overweight or obesity during adulthood were positively associated with PDAC, with stronger associations among those with early onset adiposity and those with male sex. Avoidance of excess body weight throughout the adult life course may prevent PDAC.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'OBJECTIVE: Adipose tissue is the largest endocrine organ. When activated by cancer cells, adipocytes secrete adipocytokines and release fatty acids, which are then transferred to cancer cells and used for structural and biochemical support. How this metabolic symbiosis between cancer cells and adipocytes affects skeletal muscle and thermogenesis during cancer cachexia is unknown. Cancer cachexia is a multiorgan syndrome and how the communication between tissues is established has yet to be determined. We investigated adipose tissue secretory factors and explored their role in crosstalk of adipocytes, muscle, and tumor during pancreatic cancer cachexia. METHODS: We used a pancreatic cancer cachexia mouse model generated by syngenic implantation of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells (KPC) intraperitoneally into C57BL/6 mice and Lcn2-knockout mice. For in vitro studies, adipocytes (3T3-L1 and primary adipocytes), cachectic cancer cells (Panc0203), non-cachectic cancer cells (Du145 cells), and skeletal muscle cells (C2C12 myoblasts) were used. RESULTS: To identify molecules involved in the crosstalk of adipose tissue with muscle and tumors, we treated 3T3-L1 adipocytes with conditioned medium (CM) from cancer cells. Upon screening the secretomes from PDAC-induced adipocytes, several adipocytokines were identified, including lipocalin 2 (Lcn2). We investigated Lcn2 as a potential mediator of cachexia induced by adipocytes in response to PDAC. During tumor progression, mice exhibited a decline in body weight gain, which was accompanied by loss of adipose and muscle tissues. Tumor-harboring mice developed drastic hypothermia because of a dramatic loss of fat in brown adipose tissue (BAT) and suppression of the thermogenesis pathway. We inhibited Lcn2 with an anti-Lcn2 antibody neutralization or genomic ablation in mice. Lcn2 deficiency significantly improved body temperature in tumor-bearing mice, which was supported by the increased expression of Ucp1 and beta3-adrenergic receptor in BAT. In addition, Lcn2 inhibition abrogated the loss of fat and muscle in tumor-bearing mice. In contrast to tumor-bearing WT mice, the corresponding Lcn2-knockout mice showed reduced ATGL expression in iWAT and decreased the expression of muscle atrophy molecular markers MuRF-1 and Fbx32. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that Lcn2 is causally involved in the dysregulation of adipose tissue-muscle-tumor crosstalk during pancreatic cancer cachexia. Therapeutic targets that suppress Lcn2 may minimize the progression of cachexia.',\n",

       "  'AB': \"CONTEXT: Patients with pancreatic cancer (PC) at a late stage often suffer from severe abdominal pain due to the invasion of celiac plexus, and the analgesics they receive often have intolerable side effects. Endoscopic, ultrasound-guided, celiac plexus neurolysis (EUS-guided CPN) can have a good therapeutic effect. OBJECTIVE: The study intended to evaluate the ability of two nursing cooperation patterns to reduce patients' pain, decrease operation times, increase operational efficiency, and increase nurses' satisfaction, for patients with advanced PC and abdominal pain who received EUS-guided CPN. DESIGN: The research team designed a retrospective controlled study. SETTING: The study took place at the Shenzhen People's Hospital of the Second Clinical Medical College of Jinan University in Shenzhen, China, and at the Changhai Hospital of the Second Military Medical University in Shanghai, China. PARTICIPANTS: Participants were 40 patients with advanced PC who received EUS-guided CPN at one of the two hospitals between January 2019 and January 2020. INTERVENTION: Twenty participants at Changhai Hospital received the traditional nursing cooperation pattern and became the control group, and 20 participants at the Shenzhen People's Hospital received the new nursing cooperation pattern and became the intervention group. OUTCOME MEASURES: The study measured clinical data, nursing measures, diagnostic significance, and key points for the two patterns as well as compared the effects of the new nursing cooperation method to that of traditional nursing. If the measurement data met the requirements for normality, the team used the two independent sample t-test for the intergroup comparisons. If normality wasn't satisfied, the team used medians and interquartile ranges (IQRs) for expression and the rank sum test for the intergroup comparisons. Counting data were expressed using the constituent ratio, and team used the chi-square test for comparisons between groups. P < .05 was considered to be statistically significant. RESULTS: The operations were successful, and no complications occurred. No significant difference existed in the pain scores between the control group and the intervention group (P > .05), while a significant difference occurred in the nurses' operation times and satisfaction. Not only were the scores for operation times for the control group (97) and the intervention group (59) significantly different, but also the nurses' satisfaction was significantly higher for the intervention group postintervention, at 83.35 +/- 5.25, than for the control group, at 62.25 +/- 8.18 (P < .001). Such a new nursing cooperation method could assist in patient's rehabilitation and increase nurses' satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS: The new nursing cooperation method for patients with advanced PC and abdominal pain undergoing EUS-guided CPN can reduce operation time and improve nurses' satisfaction.\",\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: The etiology of pancreatic cancer remains unclear. This limits the possibility of prevention and effective treatment. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is responsible for the development of different types of cancer, but its role in pancreatic cancer is still being discussed. AIM: To assess the prevalence of previous HBV infection and to identify viral biomarkers in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) to support the role of the virus in etiology of this cancer. METHODS: The data of 130 hepatitis B surface antigen-negative subjects were available for the final analysis, including 60 patients with PDAC confirmed by cytology or histology and 70 sex- and age-matched controls. All the participants were tested for HBV biomarkers in blood [antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc), antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs) and HBV DNA], and for those with PDAC, biomarkers in resected pancreatic tissues were tested (HBV DNA, HBV pregenomic RNA and covalently closed circular DNA). We performed immunohistochemistry staining of pancreatic tissues for hepatitis B virus X antigen and Ki-67 protein. Non-parametric statistics were used for the analysis. RESULTS: Anti-HBc was detected in 18/60 (30%) patients with PDAC and in 9/70 (13%) participants in the control group (P = 0.029). Accordingly, the odds of PDAC in anti-HBc-positive subjects were higher compared to those with no previous HBV infection (odds ratio: 2.905, 95% confidence interval: 1.191-7.084, standard error 0.455). HBV DNA was detected in 8 cases of PDAC and in 6 of them in the pancreatic tumor tissue samples only (all patients were anti-HBc positive). Blood HBV DNA was negative in all subjects of the control group with positive results of the serum anti-HBc test. Among 9 patients with PDAC, 5 revealed signs of replicative competence of the virus (covalently closed circular DNA with or without pregenomic RNA) in the pancreatic tumor tissue samples. Hepatitis B virus X antigen expression and active cell proliferation was revealed by immunohistochemistry in 4 patients with PDAC in the pancreatic tumor tissue samples. CONCLUSION: We found significantly higher risks of PDAC in anti-HBc-positive patients. Detection of viral replication and hepatitis B virus X protein expression in the tumor tissue prove involvement of HBV infection in pancreatic cancer development.',\n",

METHODS: This study investigated this question among 145,489 participants who gave rise to 696 incident cases of pancreatic cancer over a median follow-up of 12 years in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial. At baseline, participants were asked to recall their weight at ages 20, 50, and 55 to 74 years (at enrollment), as well as their height. RESULTS: At age 50 years, people with obesity had a significantly increased risk of pancreatic cancer compared with those with a normal weight after adjustment for confounders (hazard ratio [95% CI]: 1.27 [1.01-1.60]). Individuals who had overweight at age 20 years experienced a marginally significant elevated risk of pancreatic cancer (hazard ratio [95% CI]: 1.22 [0.99-1.50]). Compared with individuals who maintained a steady normal weight during follow-up, no significantly altered risk of pancreatic cancer was observed for those whose weight status changed from normal weight to overweight, from normal weight to obesity, and from overweight to obesity. CONCLUSIONS: The present study revealed that prediagnostic adulthood BMI trajectory was not associated with pancreatic cancer risk, but overweight at young adulthood and obesity at middle adulthood may confer an elevated risk of this malignancy.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'PURPOSE: To characterize the prevalence of missed pancreatic masses and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC)-related findings on CT and MRI between pre-diagnostic patients and healthy individuals. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients diagnosed with PDAC (2010-2016) were retrospectively reviewed for abdominal CT- or MRI-examinations 1 month-3 years prior to their diagnosis, and subsequently matched to controls in a 1:4 ratio. Two blinded radiologists scored each imaging exam on the presence of a pancreatic mass and secondary features of PDAC. Additionally, original radiology reports were graded based on the revised RADPEER criteria. RESULTS: The cohort of 595 PDAC patients contained 60 patients with a pre-diagnostic CT and 27 with an MRI. A pancreatic mass was suspected in hindsight on CT in 51.7% and 50% of cases and in 1.3% and 0.9% of controls by reviewer 1 (p < .001) and reviewer 2 (p < .001), respectively. On MRI, a mass was suspected in 70.4% and 55.6% of cases and 2.9% and 0% of the controls by reviewer 1 (p < .001) and reviewer 2 (p < .001), respectively. Pancreatic duct dilation, duct interruption, focal atrophy, and features of acute pancreatitis is strongly associated with PDAC (p < .001). In cases, a RADPEER-score of 2 or 3 was assigned to 56.3% of the CT-reports and 71.4% of MRI-reports. CONCLUSION: Radiological features as pancreatic duct dilation and interruption, and focal atrophy are common first signs of PDAC and are often missed or unrecognized. Further investigation with dedicated pancreas imaging is warranted in patients with PDAC-related radiological findings.',\n",

METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed on the clinical data of 32 patients with advanced pancreatic cancer treated with sintilimab regimen from January 2019 to December 2021 in our hospital. All patients were followed up until death or April 2022, in the form of outpatient, in-hospital review, or telephone follow-up. Follow-up content included routine blood, liver and kidney functions, tumor markers, plain or enhanced abdominal CT, and abdominal MRI examinations. Clinical efficacy was evaluated according to mRECIST criteria, and the severity of adverse effects was evaluated according to American Institute for Cancer Research (AICR) Standard Term for Adverse Events, Version 5.0. RESULTS: During treatment, the dosage of sintilimab was halved in 2 patients due to adverse reactions. All patients were treated with sintilimab for 1~10 times, with an average of 6 +/- 4 times. The total response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR) were 6.25% and 12.50% and 25.00% and 37.50%, respectively, after 1 and 3 months of treatment. The mean follow-up time of 32 patients was 1-12 months, and the median follow-up time was 4 +/- 3 months. By the end point of follow-up, a total of 25 patients died, and the median progression-free survival (PFS) was 3.8 (95% CI (1.85-5.63)) months. The median overall survival (OS) was 5.1 months (95% CI (3.63~7.68). After treatment, the levels of tumor markers CA125, CEA and CA199 were partly decreased compared with those before treatment (all P < 0.001). After treatment, the blood routine indexes d-dimer, CRP (C-reactive protein), NLR (neutral granulocyte to lymphocyte ratio), and MLR (monocyte to lymphocyte ratio) decreased compared with those before treatment. In 32 patients with advanced pancreatic cancer, the adverse reactions with an incidence more than 10% included fatigue, rash, hypothyroidism, hyperuricemia, and renal insufficiency. Only 2 patients showed grade 3 fatigue symptom, and all the others showed no adverse reactions of grades 3~5. In this study, all patients' adverse reactions were relieved after symptomatic treatment. CONCLUSION: Gemcitabine chemotherapy in multiline treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer with sintilimab can achieve certain clinical benefits without serious adverse reactions.\",\n",

       "  'AB': 'Pancreatic cancer (PC) patients are highly prone to cachexia, a lethal wasting syndrome featuring muscle wasting with an undefined etiology. Recent data indicate that certain murine cancer cells induce muscle wasting by releasing Hsp70 and Hsp90 through extracellular vesicles (EVs) to activate p38beta MAPK-mediated catabolic pathways primarily through Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). However, whether human PC induces cachexia through releasing Hsp70 and Hsp90 is undetermined. Here, we investigated whether patient-derived PC cells induce muscle cell atrophy directly through this mechanism. We compared cancer cells isolated from patient-derived xenografts (PDX) from three PC patients who had cachexia (PCC) with those of three early-stage lung cancer patients without cachexia (LCC) and two renal cancer patients who were not prone to cachexia (RCC). We observed small increases of Hsp70 and Hsp90 released by LCC and RCC in comparison to non-cancer control cells (NCC). However, PCC released markedly higher levels of Hsp70 and Hsp90 (~ 6-fold on average) than LCC and RCC. In addition, PCC released similarly increased levels of Hsp70/90-containing EVs. In contrast to RCC and LCC, PCC-conditioned media induced a potent catabolic response in C2C12 myotubes including the activation of p38 MAPK and transcription factor C/EBPbeta, upregulation of E3 ligases UBR2 and MAFbx, and increase of autophagy marker LC3-II, resulting in the loss of the myosin heavy chain (MHC ~50%) and myotube diameter (~60%). Importantly, the catabolic response was attenuated by Hsp70- and Hsp90-neutralizing antibodies in a dose-dependent manner. These data suggest that human PC cells release high levels of Hsp70 and Hsp90 that induce muscle atrophy through a direct action on muscle cells.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'In addition to the poor prognosis, excruciating abdominal pain is a major challenge in pancreatic cancer. Neurotropism appears to be the underlying mechanism leading to neuronal invasion. However, there is a lack of animal models suitable for translationally bridging in vitro findings with clinical trials. We characterized KPC (Kras(G12D/+); Trp53(R172H/+); P48-Cre) and KPPC (Kras(G12D/+); Trp53(R172H/R172H); P48-Cre) mice with genetically determined pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and compared them with an orthotopic pancreatic cancer mouse model, healthy littermates and human tissue. We analyzed behavioral correlates of cancer-associated pain and well-being, and studied neuronal remodeling and cytokine expression. Histologically, we found similarities between KPC and KPPC tissue with human samples. Compared to healthy littermates, we detect nerve fiber hypertrophy, which was not restricted to a certain fiber type. Interestingly, while KPPC mice showed significantly reduced well-being, KPC mice emerged to be better suited for studying long-lasting cancer pain that emerges over a slow course of tumor progression. To address the neuroinflammatory correlate of loss of well-being, we studied cytokine levels in KPPC mice and observed a significant upregulation of CXCL16, TNFRSF5, CCL24, CXCL1, CCL22, CLL20 and CX2CL1. In summary, we demonstrate that the KPC mouse model is best suited to studying cancer pain, whereas the KPPC model can be employed to study cancer-associated reduction in well-being.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Cancer cachexia, a paraneoplastic syndrome characterized by ongoing skeletal muscle mass loss, is accompanied by adipose tissue loss and strongly affects chemotherapy endurance. Our aim was to detect a serum marker reflecting pancreatic cancer cachexia and predicting subsequent loss of muscle mass and adipose tissue, focusing on adipose tissue-secreted proteins. Murine-derived pancreatic cancer cells were orthotopically injected into the mouse pancreatic tail. After 3 weeks, RNA sequencing of perigonadal fat and orthotopic tumors was carried out. We analyzed stocked sera and clinical data of metastatic pancreatic cancer patients who received chemotherapy. Perigonadal fat weight/body weight decreased in mice with orthotopic tumors compared to those without tumors. By RNA sequencing and real-time PCR validation, pentraxin 3 (PTX3) was identified as a secreted protein-encoded gene whose expression was significantly higher in the perigonadal fat of mice with orthotopic tumors than in that of mice without orthotopic tumors and was least expressed in orthotopic tumors. Serum PTX3 levels correlated with PTX3 mRNA levels in perigonadal fat and were higher in mice with orthotopic tumors than in those without tumors. In 84 patients diagnosed with metastatic pancreatic cancer, patients with high serum PTX3 levels showed a greater visceral fat loss/month and skeletal muscle mass index (SMI) decrease/month than those with low serum PTX3 levels. High serum PTX3 was an independent risk factor for visceral fat loss, decreased SMI, and poor prognosis. High serum PTX3 in pancreatic cancer patients predicts visceral fat and muscle mass loss and major clinical outcomes of cancer cachexia.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: circRNA has been established to play a pivotal role in tumorigenesis development in a variety of cancers; nevertheless, the biological functions and molecular mechanisms of hypoxia-induced exosomal circRNAs in pancreatic cancer remain largely unknown. METHODS: Differentially expressed circRNAs in exosomes between hypoxic exosomes and normoxic exosomes in PC cells were verified by RNA sequencing. The expression of circPDK1 in PC tumors and PC patients was evaluated by qRT-PCR and ISH, and the biological functions of circPDK1 in PC were verified through a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments. Using Western blotting, Co-IP, RNA pull-down, ChIP, RIP, dual-luciferase assays, and rescue experiments, the underlying mechanism of circPDK1 was verified. RESULTS: CircPDK1 was highly abundant in PC tumor tissues and serum exosomes and was associated with poor survival. Exosomal circPDK1 significantly promoted PC cell proliferation, migration, and glycolysis both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, circPDK1 could be activated by HIF1A at the transcriptional level and sponges miR-628-3p to activate the BPTF/c-myc axis. In addition, circPDK1 serves as a scaffold that enhances the interaction between UBE2O and BIN1, inducing the UBE2O-mediated degradation of BIN1. CONCLUSIONS: We found that circPDK1 was activated by HIF1A at the transcriptional level by modulating the miR-628-3p/BPTF axis and degrading BIN1. Exosomal circPDK1 is a promising biomarker for PC diagnosis and prognosis and represents a potential therapeutic target for PC.',\n",

       "  'AB': \"OBJECTIVES: To investigate if different methods of pancreatoduodenectomy (with or without pyloric preservation) would have different impacts on postoperative nutrition and body composition changes among pancreatic cancer patients. METHODS: Demographic and clinicopathological data, perioperative data were collected, body composition (e.g. skeletal muscle cross-sectional area [CSA], visceral fat area [VFA]) were evaluated with abdominal CT before and after surgery. Sarcopenia patients' proportion changes were also recorded. RESULTS: The hospital stay in the PRPD group was significantly less than that in the PPPD group (p < 0.05). A significant difference was found in CSA, skeletal muscle index (SMI), VFA, VFA/CSA and albumin (ALB) in both groups between preoperative, 3, and 12 months after surgery. The loss of visceral fat in the PRPD group was more prominent than that in the PPPD group at 3 months and 12 months after surgery (p < 0.05). VFA/CSA was higher in the PPPD group than in the PRPD group (3 months: p < 0.05, 12 months: p < 0.001). The proportion of sarcopenic patients increased significantly over time in the PPPD and PRPD groups (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative CSA and VFA continued to significantly decrease in both PPPD and PRPD groups, while the incidence of sarcopenia continued to increase. Compared with PRPD, PPPD has a protective effect on visceral fat. PPPD may contribute to better maintaining visceral fat mass and blood ALB levels. CT quantification can be an objective and effective method to evaluate the nutritional status of pancreatic cancer patients during the pre- and postoperative period and can provide a useful objective basis for guiding clinical treatment.\",\n",

       "  'AB': 'Mutations in the splicing factor SF3B1 are frequently occurring in various cancers and drive tumor progression through the activation of cryptic splice sites in multiple genes. Recent studies also demonstrate a positive correlation between the expression levels of wild-type SF3B1 and tumor malignancy. Here, we demonstrate that SF3B1 is a hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1 target gene that positively regulates HIF1 pathway activity. By physically interacting with HIF1alpha, SF3B1 facilitates binding of the HIF1 complex to hypoxia response elements (HREs) to activate target gene expression. To further validate the relevance of this mechanism for tumor progression, we show that a reduction in SF3B1 levels via monoallelic deletion of Sf3b1 impedes tumor formation and progression via impaired HIF signaling in a mouse model for pancreatic cancer. Our work uncovers an essential role of SF3B1 in HIF1 signaling, thereby providing a potential explanation for the link between high SF3B1 expression and aggressiveness of solid tumors.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Hypoxia plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of pancreatic cancer, but the effect of hypoxia-related genes in pancreatic cancer remains to be elucidated. This study aimed to identify hypoxia-related genes related to pancreatic cancer and construct a prognostic signature. METHODS: Pancreatic cancer datasets were retrieved from TCGA database. Cox regression analyses were used to identify hypoxia-related genes and construct a prognostic signature. Datasets from International Cancer Genome Consortium and GEO databases were used as validated cohorts. The CIBERSORT method was applied to estimate the fractions of immune cell types. DNA methylation and protein levels of the genes in pancreatic cancer were examined. RESULTS: Three hypoxia-related genes (TES, LDHA, and ANXA2) were identified as associated with patient survival and selected to construct a prognostic signature. Patients were divided into high- and low-risk groups based on the signature. Those in the high-risk group showed worse survival than those in the low-risk group. The signature was shown to be involved in the HIF-1 signaling pathway. The time-dependent ROC analyses of three independent validated cohorts further revealed that this signature had a better prognostic value in the prediction of the survival of pancreatic cancer patients. Immune cells analysis for three datasets demonstrated that high-risk signature was significantly associated with macrophages and T cells. DNA methylation and protein levels of the three genes validated their aberrant expression in pancreatic cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Our research provided a novel and reliable prognostic signature that composes of three hypoxia-related genes to estimate the prognosis of pancreatic cancer.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND & AIMS: Rapid deconditioning, also called cachexia, and metabolic reprogramming are two hallmarks of pancreatic cancer. Acetyl-coenzyme A synthetase short-chain family member 2 (ACSS2) is an acetyl-enzyme A synthetase that contributes to lipid synthesis and epigenetic reprogramming. However, the role of ACSS2 on the nonselective macropinocytosis and cancer cachexia in pancreatic cancer remains elusive. In this study, we demonstrate that ACSS2 potentiates macropinocytosis and muscle wasting through metabolic reprogramming in pancreatic cancer. METHODS: Clinical significance of ACSS2 was analyzed using samples from patients with pancreatic cancer. ACSS2-knockout cells were established using the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-associated protein 9 system. Single-cell RNA sequencing data from genetically engineered mouse models was analyzed. The macropinocytotic index was evaluated by dextran uptake assay. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay was performed to validate transcriptional activation. ACSS2-mediated tumor progression and muscle wasting were examined in orthotopic xenograft models. RESULTS: Metabolic stress induced ACSS2 expression, which is associated with worse prognosis in pancreatic cancer. ACSS2 knockout significantly suppressed cell proliferation in 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional models. Macropinocytosis-associated genes are upregulated in tumor tissues and are correlated with worse prognosis. ACSS2 knockout inhibited macropinocytosis. We identified Zrt- and Irt-like protein 4 (ZIP4) as a downstream target of ACSS2, and knockdown of ZIP4 reversed ACSS2-induced macropinocytosis. ACSS2 upregulated ZIP4 through ETV4-mediated transcriptional activation. ZIP4 induces macropinocytosis through cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element-binding protein-activated syndecan 1 (SDC1) and dynamin 2 (DNM2). Meanwhile, ZIP4 drives muscle wasting and cachexia via glycogen synthase kinase-beta (GSK3beta)-mediated secretion of tumor necrosis factor superfamily member 10 (TRAIL or TNFSF10). ACSS2 knockout attenuated muscle wasting and extended survival in orthotopic mouse models. CONCLUSIONS: ACSS2-mediated metabolic reprogramming activates the ZIP4 pathway, and promotes macropinocytosis via SDC1/DNM2 and drives muscle wasting through the GSK3beta/TRAIL axis, which potentially provides additional nutrients for macropinocytosis in pancreatic cancer.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Immune cells can mount desirable anti-cancer immunity. However, some immune cells can support cancer disease progression. The presence of cancer can lead to production of immature myeloid cells from the bone marrow known as myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). The immunosuppressive and pro-tumorigenic effects of MDSCs are well understood. Whether MDSCs are involved in promoting cancer cachexia is not well understood. We orthotopically injected the pancreas of mice with KPC cells or PBS. One group of tumor-bearing mice was treated with an anti-Ly6G antibody that depletes granulocytic MDSCs and neutrophils; the other received a control antibody. Anti-Ly6G treatment delayed body mass loss, reduced tibialis anterior (TA) muscle wasting, abolished TA muscle fiber atrophy, reduced diaphragm muscle fiber atrophy of type IIb and IIx fibers, and reduced atrophic gene expression in the TA muscles. Anti-ly6G treatment resulted in greater than 50% Ly6G+ cell depletion efficiency in the tumors and TA muscles. These data show that, in the orthotopic KPC model, anti-Ly6G treatment reduces the number of Ly6G+ cells in the tumor and skeletal muscle and reduces skeletal muscle atrophy. These data implicate Ly6G+ cells, including granulocytic MDSCs and neutrophils, as possible contributors to the development of pancreatic cancer-induced skeletal muscle wasting.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'The association between non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and the risk of pancreatic cancer in the general population remains unclear. This nationwide cohort study included 8,120,674 adults who underwent a national health screening in 2009 from the Korean National Health Insurance Service database. Participants were followed-up until December 2017 for the development of pancreatic cancer. NAFLD was assessed using the fatty liver index: >/= 60, NAFLD and < 30, no NAFLD. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression was performed. During the follow-up of 59.1 million person-years, 10,470 participants were newly diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. NAFLD was significantly associated with an increased risk of pancreatic cancer compared to no NAFLD (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.17; 95% CI 1.09-1.26). This association was significant in both the obese (aHR, 1.14; 95% CI 1.05-1.23) and non-obese groups (aHR, 1.14; 95% CI 1.003-1.29). Individuals with fatty liver index 30-59 also had an increased risk (aHR, 1.10; 95% CI 1.05-1.16). The risk of pancreatic cancer increased with increasing fatty liver index scores (P for trend < 0.001). This study demonstrated that NAFLD was independently associated with an increased risk of pancreatic cancer, regardless of obesity. Our finding suggests that NAFLD may be a modifiable risk factor for pancreatic cancer.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Pancreatic cancer (PC) frequency and incidence have grown rapidly in recent years. One of the most serious problems with PC is the existence of asymptotic manifestations, which frequently delays early detection, and until the diagnosis is established, tumor cells progress to the metastatic stage. Another significant concern with PC is the scarcity of well-defined pharmacotherapeutic drugs. The aim of this study was to develop an efficient nanocarrier system to augment the efficacy of raloxifene (RLX) against PC cells. As a result, the current investigation was carried out in order to give an effective treatment method, in which an optimum RLX loaded phospholipid-based vesicles with melittin (PL-MEL) was chosen using experimental design software, with particle size, zeta potential and entrapment efficiency % as dependent variables. Furthermore, anticancer activity against PANC1 cells was assessed. The optimized nanovesicle parameters were 172.5 nm for the measured size, zeta potential of -0.69 mV, and entrapment efficiency of 76.91% that were in good agreement with the expected ones. RLX-raw, plain formula, and optimized RLX-PL-MEL showed IC(50) concentrations of 26.07 +/- 0.98, 9.166 +/- 0.34, and 1.24 +/- 0.05 microg/mL, respectively. Furthermore, cell cycle analysis revealed that the nanovesicle was most effective in the G2-M phase, whereas Bax, and Bcl-2 estimates revealed that optimized RLX formula had the highest apoptotic activity among treatments investigated. However, as compared to RLX alone or plain formula alone, the optimized formula demonstrated higher expression of TNFalpha and Bax while a significant reduction of Bcl-2 and NF-kappaB expression was observed. mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) analysis confirmed the apoptosis as well as the anticancer effect of the optimized formula. Thus, the present study results showed an improvement in the anti-PC effects of the RLX with phospholipid conjugated melittin, making it a novel treatment approach against PC.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Intravenous lidocaine has been postulated to improve long-term survival after surgery for pancreatic cancer through anti-inflammatory effects, anti-tumour effects, or both. We investigated whether intraoperative lidocaine improves survival after pancreatectomy for pancreatic cancer and whether lidocaine modified the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), high levels of which are associated with poor prognosis. METHODS: Patients undergoing pancreatectomy were randomly assigned to i.v. lidocaine (continuous intraoperative infusion of 2 mg kg(-1) h(-1), after 1.5 mg kg(-1) bolus at induction of anaesthesia) or saline placebo. The co-primary outcomes were survival/disease-free survival 3 yr after surgery. Secondary outcomes (masked to treatment allocation) included intraoperative opioid (sufentanil) dose, postoperative complications, and circulating and tumour-associated NETs (immunofluorescence assay, enzyme-linked immune assay, or both). RESULTS: A total of 563 participants (34.6% female; median age, 64 yr) completed 3 yr of clinical follow-up. Overall, 283 participants were randomised to lidocaine infusion, and 280 participants were randomised to placebo. Infusion of lidocaine did not alter overall (hazard ratio [HR]=0.98; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.81-1.17; P=0.79) or disease-free survival (HR=0.91; 95% CI, 0.71-1.17; P=0.44). Mean intraoperative sufentanil dose was reduced by lidocaine infusion (47.6 mug [4.6]) compared with placebo (68.4 mug [4.8]; P<0.001), but postoperative complications and length of hospital stay were similar between groups. Circulating NETs were lower after lidocaine infusion up to 3 days after surgery, but tumour-associated NETs were not altered by intraoperative treatment. CONCLUSION: In patients undergoing pancreatectomy for pancreatic cancer, intraoperative infusion of lidocaine did not improve overall or disease-free survival. Reduced formation of circulating NETs was absent in pancreatic tumour tissue. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT03245346; updated in Chi-CTR-2000035469.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Obesity is a global epidemic and a major predisposing factor for cancer. Increasing evidence shows that obesity-associated stress is a key driver of cancer risk and progression. Previous work has identified the phase-separation organelles, stress granules (SG), as mutant KRAS-dependent mediators of stress adaptation. However, the dependence of tumorigenesis on these organelles is unknown. Here, we establish a causal link between SGs and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Importantly, we uncover that dependence on SGs is drastically heightened in obesity-associated PDAC. Furthermore, we identify a previously unknown regulator and component of SGs, namely, the serine/arginine protein kinase 2 (SRPK2), as a specific determinant of SG formation in obesity-associated PDAC. We show that SRPK2-mediated SG formation in obesity-associated PDAC is driven by hyperactivation of the IGF1/PI3K/mTOR/S6K1 pathway and that S6K1 inhibition selectively attenuates SGs and impairs obesity-associated PDAC development. SIGNIFICANCE: : We show that stress adaptation via the phase-separation organelles SGs mediates PDAC development. Moreover, preexisting stress conditions such as obesity are a driving force behind tumor SG dependence, and enhanced SG levels are key determinants and a chemopreventive target for obesity-associated PDAC.

       "  'AB': 'Intratumoral hypoxia is a common feature of pancreatic cancer (PC) and also plays a role in its progression. However, hypoxia-regulated signatures in PC are still not completely understood. This study aimed to identify core hypoxia-associated genes and determine their underlying molecular mechanisms in PC cells. Transformer 2 alpha homolog (TRA2A) was found to be an important hypoxia-associated gene, which was upregulated in PC tissues and in PC cells cultured under hypoxia. High TRA2A expression was associated with advanced stage, poor differentiation, and lymph node metastasis. Under normoxic and hypoxic conditions, knockdown of TRA2A both markedly suppressed PC cell proliferation and motility in vitro and in vivo, as well as activation of the AKT pathway. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 subunit alpha (HIF1alpha) upregulated the transcription of TRA2A by directly binding to its promoter. TRA2A showed a co-expression relationship with HIF1alpha in PC tissues. Overexpression of TRA2A alleviated the pro-inhibitive functions of HIF1alpha-inhibition on PC cell proliferation and motility under hypoxia. In conclusion, TRA2A is a crucial downstream gene of HIF1alpha that accelerates the proliferation and motility of PC cells. TRA2A may be a novel and practical molecular target for investigating the hypoxic response of PC cells.Abbreviations: TRA2A, transformer 2A protein; PC, pancreatic cancer; HIF1alpha, hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha; GEO, Gene Expression Omnibus; IHC, immunohistochemical staining.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Skeletal muscle wasting critically impairs the survival and quality of life in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). To identify the local factors initiating muscle wasting, we studied inflammation, fiber cross-sectional area (CSA), composition, amino acid metabolism and capillarization, as well as the integrity of neuromuscular junctions (NMJ, pre-/postsynaptic co-staining) and mitochondria (electron microscopy) in the hindlimb muscle of LSL-KrasG12D/+; LSL-TrP53R172H/+; Pdx1-Cre mice with intraepithelial-neoplasia (PanIN) 1-3 and PDAC, compared to wild-type mice (WT). Significant decreases in fiber CSA occurred with PDAC but not with PanIN 1-3, compared to WT: These were found in the gastrocnemius (type 2x: -20.0%) and soleus (type 2a: -21.0%, type 1: -14.2%) muscle with accentuation in the male soleus (type 2a: -24.8%, type 1: -17.4%) and female gastrocnemius muscle (-29.6%). Significantly higher densities of endomysial CD68+ and cyclooxygenase-2+ (COX2+) cells were detected in mice with PDAC, compared to WT mice. Surprisingly, CD68+ and COX2+ cell densities were also higher in mice with PanIN 1-3 in both muscles. Significant positive correlations existed between muscular and hepatic CD68+ or COX2+ cell densities. Moreover, in the gastrocnemius muscle, suppressor-of-cytokine-3 (SOCS3) expressions was upregulated >2.7-fold with PanIN 1A-3 and PDAC. The intracellular pools of proteinogenic amino acids and glutathione significantly increased with PanIN 1A-3 compared to WT. Capillarization, NMJ, and mitochondrial ultrastructure remained unchanged with PanIN or PDAC. In conclusion, the onset of fiber atrophy coincides with the manifestation of PDAC and high-grade local (and hepatic) inflammatory infiltration without compromised microcirculation, innervation or mitochondria. Surprisingly, muscular and hepatic inflammation, SOCS3 upregulation and (proteolytic) increases in free amino acids and glutathione were already detectable in mice with precancerous PanINs. Studies of initial local triggers and defense mechanisms regarding cachexia are warranted for targeted anti-inflammatory prevention.',\n",

A large number of abnormal blood vessels and high-density fibrous matrices in pancreatic cancer will lead to hypoxia within tumor tissue and hinder immune cell infiltration. We used low-dose X-ray irradiation, also known as low-dose radiation therapy (LDRT), to normalize the blood vessels in pancreatic cancer, while simultaneously administering an inhibitor of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) to reduce pancreatic cancer fibrosis. We found that this treatment successfully reduced pancreatic cancer hypoxia, increased immune cell infiltration, and increased sensitivity to radiation therapy for pancreatic cancer.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'The pathological prognostic factors in pancreatic cancer patients who have received neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) are still elusive. The aim of the present study was to investigate the prognostic potential of histological tumor necrosis (HTN) in patients who received NAT and to evaluate tumor changes after NAT. HTN was studied in 44 pancreatic cancer patients who received NAT followed by surgery (NAT group) compared with 263 patients who received upfront surgery (UFS group). The prognostic factors in the NAT group were analyzed, and carbonic anhydrase 9 (CA‑9) expression was compared between the NAT and USF group to evaluate the hypoxic microenvironment changes during NAT. HTN was found in 15 of 44 patients in the NAT group, and its frequency was lower than that in the UFS group (34 vs. 51%, P=0.04). Cox proportional hazards models identified HTN as an independent risk factor for relapse‑free survival in the NAT group [risk ratio (RR), 5.60; 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.27‑14.26, P<0.01]. Significant correlations were found between HTN and CA‑9 expression both in the NAT and UFS groups (P<0.01 for both). CA‑9 expression was significantly upregulated in the NAT group overall, although this upregulation was specifically induced in patients without HTN. In conclusion, HTN was a poor prognostic factor in pancreatic cancer patients receiving NAT followed by surgery, and the present study suggests a close association between HTN and tumor hypoxia. Increased hypoxia after NAT may support the thesis for re‑engineering the hypoxia‑alleviating tumor microenvironment in NAT regimens for pancreatic cancer.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Sarcopenia in pancreatic cancer may increase the risk of chemotherapy-related toxicity and post-operative morbidity. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to quantify the prevalence of sarcopenia in early stage pancreatic cancer. METHODS: Relevant studies were identified using Ovid Medline and Elsevier Embase. Pooled estimates of prevalence rates (percentages) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) were computed using a random-effects model to allow for heterogeneity between studies. RESULTS: The majority of the 33 studies (n = 5,593 patients) included in this meta-analysis utilized computed tomography (CT)-derived measures for body composition assessment in patients undergoing pancreatic resection. Reported prevalence of sarcopenia varied between 14 and 74%, and the pooled prevalence was 39% (95% CI: 38-40%) Heterogeneity was considerable, however, (I2 = 93%) and did not improve significantly when controlling for assessment method, and use of pre-defined cut-offs for sarcopenia, limiting potential to evaluate the true impact of sarcopenia. CONCLUSION: The ready availability of sequential CT offers a valuable opportunity for body composition assessment, but the quality of assessment and interpretation must improve before the impact of body composition on treatment-related outcomes and survival can be assessed. We suggest recommendations for the assessment of body composition for the design of future studies.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to analyze the trends of pancreatic cancer mortality in Spain from 1955-2020 in both genders and every age group, in order to describe the changes in the prevalence of some risk factors and their possible influence on mortality. METHODS: Direct standardized mortality rates were calculated using the World Standard Population 2000-2025 and Joinpoint analysis was performed for age-specific and age-standardized mortality trends for the period from 1955-2020. RESULTS: Mortality rates increased with age in both genders, with a marked increase in older groups. During 2020, 71.5% of male deaths and 81.5% of female deaths from pancreatic cancer occurred among those aged 65 years or more. Spanish National Health Surveys since 1987 show decreasing trends in daily smoking, but striking increases in obesity and diabetes mellitus rates in both genders, and rates of daily smoking and obesity are remarkably higher among disadvantaged social classes. CONCLUSIONS: Pancreatic cancer mortality rates have increased uninterruptedly in Spain during the last decades. Increasing trends in obesity and diabetes mellitus, particularly among males, and the different prevalence of obesity and smoking according to social class are public health problems of great concern. Smoking and obesity are potentially avoidable risk factors. Thus, educational programs and legislative measures should be implemented more widely, such as programs for smoking prevention, healthy nutrition and physical exercise, and would be applied more intensively in the most disadvantaged social classes.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Cachexia is frequent, deadly, and untreatable for patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). The reproductive hormone and cytokine Activin is a mediator of PDAC cachexia, and Activin receptor targeting was clinically tested for cancer cachexia therapy. However, sex-specific manifestations and mechanisms are poorly understood, constraining development of effective treatments. METHODS: Cachexia phenotypes, muscle gene/protein expression, and effects of the Activin blocker ACVR2B/Fc were assessed in LSL-Kras(G12D/+) , LSL-Trp53(R172H/+) , and Pdx-1-Cre (KPC) mice with autochthonic PDAC. Effects of PDAC and sex hormones were modelled by treating C2C12 myotubes with KPC-cell conditioned medium (CM) and estradiol. Muscle gene expression by RNAseq and change in muscle from serial CT scans were measured in patients with PDAC. RESULTS: Despite equivalent tumour latency (median 17 weeks) and mortality (24.5 weeks), male KPC mice showed earlier and more severe cachexia than females. In early PDAC, male gastrocnemius, quadriceps, and tibialis anterior muscles were reduced (-21.7%, -18.9%, and -20.8%, respectively, all P < 0.001), with only gastrocnemius reduced in females (-16%, P < 0.01). Sex differences disappeared in late PDAC. Plasma Activin A was similarly elevated between sexes throughout, while oestrogen and testosterone levels suggested a virilizing effect of PDAC in females. Estradiol partially protected myotubes from KPC-CM induced atrophy and promoted expression of the potential Activin inhibitor Fstl1. Early-stage female mice showed greater muscle expression of Activin inhibitors Fst, Fstl1, and Fstl3; this sex difference disappeared by late-stage PDAC. ACVR2B/Fc initiated in early PDAC preserved muscle and fat only in male KPC mice, with increases of 41.2%, 52.6%, 39.3%, and 348.8%, respectively, in gastrocnemius, quadriceps, tibialis, and fat pad weights vs. vehicle controls, without effect on tumour. No protection was observed in females. At protein and RNA levels, pro-atrophy pathways were induced more strongly in early-stage males, with sex differences less evident in late-stage disease. As with mass, ACVR2B/Fc blunted atrophy-associated pathways only in males. In patients with resectable PDAC, muscle expression of Activin inhibitors FSTL1, FSLT3, and WFIKKN2/GASP2 were higher in women than men. Overall, among 124 patients on first-line gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel for PDAC, only men displayed muscle loss (P < 0.001); average muscle wasting in men was greater (-6.63 +/- 10.70% vs. -1.62 +/- 12.00% mean +/- SD, P = 0.038) and more rapid (-0.0098 +/- 0.0742%/day vs. -0.0466 +/- 0.1066%/day, P = 0.017) than in women. CONCLUSIONS: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cachexia displays sex-specific phenotypes in mice and humans, with Activin a preferential driver of muscle wasting in males. Sex is a major modulator of cachexia mechanisms. Consideration of sexual dimorphism is essential for discovery and development of effective treatments.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is notorious for its poor prognosis even after curative resection. Responses to immunotherapy are rare and related to inadequate T-cell priming. We previously demonstrated the potency of allogeneic lysate-dendritic cell (DC) vaccination in a preclinical model. Here we translate this concept to patients. METHODS: In this phase I study, patients with resected PDAC were included when they demonstrated no radiologic signs of recurrence after standard-of-care treatment. Allogeneic tumour lysate-loaded autologous monocyte-derived DCs were injected at weeks 0, 2, 4 and at months 3 and 6. Objectives are feasibility, safety and immunogenicity of allogeneic tumour-DCs. The presence of tumour antigens shared between the vaccine and patient tumours was investigated. Immunological analyses were performed on peripheral blood, skin and tumour. RESULTS: Ten patients were included. DC production and administration were successful. All patients experienced a grade 1 injection-site and infusion-related reaction. Two patients experienced a grade 2 fever and 1 patient experienced a grade 3 dyspnoea. No vaccine-related serious adverse events were observed. Shared tumour antigens were found between the vaccine and patient tumours. All evaluated patients displayed a vaccine-induced response indicated by increased frequencies of Ki67+ and activated PD-1+ circulating T-cells. In addition, treatment-induced T-cell reactivity to autologous tumour of study patients was detected. Seven out of ten patients have not experienced disease recurrence or progression at a median follow-up of 25 months (15-32 months). CONCLUSION: Allogeneic tumour lysate-DC treatment is feasible, safe and induces immune reactivity to PDAC expressed antigens.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Previously, we uncovered a patient subgroup with highly malignant pancreatic cancer with serum markers CEA(+)/CA125(+)/CA19-9 >/= 1000 U/mL (triple-positive, TP). However, the underlying immunosuppressive mechanism in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) of this subgroup is still unknown. METHODS: Human tissues were analyzed by flow cytometry, mass cytometry, and immunofluorescence staining. Mouse pancreatic ILC2s were expanded in vivo and used for RNA sequencing, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), and chemotaxis assays. FINDINGS: Through microarray data, we identified the accumulation of the hypoxia-induced factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) pathway in these TP patients. Via flow and mass cytometry, we discovered that a special subset of ILC2s were highly infiltrated in TP patients. Under the hypoxia microenvironment, ILC2s were found undergo a transition to a IL10(+) regulatory phenotype, we named ILCregs which was correlated with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) progression. Further, neoadjuvant chemotherapy could ameliorate hypoxic tumor microenvironments so that significantly reverse the regulatory phenotype of ILCregs. Moreover, most tumor ILC2 were CD103(-), which indicated its circulatory origin. The expression of Ccr2 was significantly upregulated on mouse ILCregs, and these cells selectively migrated to CCL2. INTERPRETATION: Our results indicate that the hypoxia microenvironment creates an immunosuppressive TIME by inducing ILCregs from a population of circulating group 2 ILCs in TP PDAC patients. FUNDING: This study was jointly supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (U21A20374, 82173091, and 81701630).',\n",

       "  'AB': \"BACKGROUND: Today, the pancreatic cancer prognosis is poor and genetic technology is developing to treat various types of cancers. Scientists are actively looking for a new technique to design a therapeutic strategy to treat pancreatic cancer. Several oncolytic viruses are known to be valuable tools for pancreatic cancer treatment. Recent Studies demonstrate their effectiveness and safety in various administration routes such as direct intratumoral, intracutaneous, intravascular, and other routes. METHOD: In this study, all studies conducted in the past 20 years have been reviewed. Reputable scientific databases including Irandoc, Scopus, Google Scholar and PubMed, are searched for the keywords of Pancreatic cancer, oncolytic, viruses and treatment and the latest information about them is obtained. RESULTS: Engineering the oncolytic viruses' genome and insertion of intended transgenes including cytokines or shRNAs, has caused promising promotions in pancreatic cancer treatment. Some oncolytic viruses inhibit tumors directly and some through activation of immune responses. CONCLUSION: This approach showed some signs of success in efficiency like immune system activation in the tumor environment, effective virus targeting in the tumor cells by systemic administration, and enhanced patient survival in comparison with the control group. But of course, until now, using these oncolytic viruses alone has not been effective in elimination of tumors.\",\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Large-scale epidemiological studies on pancreatic cancer in non-Western populations are insufficient. We investigated the risk factors for pancreatic cancer. METHODS: Using the Korean National Health Insurance database, subjects who participated in the health examination program between 2005 and 2006 were identified and followed up until 2017. Adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for pancreatic cancer risk were estimated using a Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS: During 11.5 years follow-up, 22,543 of 7,445,947 participants were newly diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. Compared with normal-weight subjects, pancreatic cancer risk was increased in those with severe obesity (BMI >/= 28 kg/m(2)) (HR = 1.16; 95% CI, 1.11-1.23). Subjects with diabetes had an increased risk compared with those without diabetes (HR = 1.48; 95% CI, 1.43-1.53). Current smokers had a higher risk than never smokers (HR = 1.43; 95% CI, 1.38-1.48). Current smoking combined with diabetes increased the risk compared with never smokers without diabetes (HR = 2.13; 95% CI, 2.00-2.28). Current smoking combined with BMI >/= 25 kg/m(2) had an increased risk compared with never smokers with BMI < 23 kg/m(2) (HR = 1.55; 95% CI, 1.46-1.65). CONCLUSION: Smoking, obesity, and diabetes are significant risk factors for pancreatic cancer in Koreans. Lifestyle modifications for smoking and obesity would be beneficial for pancreatic cancer prevention.',\n",

       "  'AB': \"Research from epidemiologic studies and experimental animal models provide insights into the role of pancreatic steatosis in the development of pancreatic cancer. Epidemiologic data demonstrate that pancreatic steatosis is widely prevalent and significantly associated with both development and progression of pancreatic cancer. By focusing on current experimental models, this review elucidates potential cellular mechanisms underlying not only the pathophysiology of pancreatic steatosis itself, but also the pathogenesis behind pancreatic steatosis's role in changing the tumour microenvironment and accelerating the development of pancreatic cancer. This review further explores the impact of bariatric surgery on pancreatic steatosis and pancreatic cancer. Synthesizing knowledge from both epidemiologic studies and experimental animal models, this review identifies gaps in current knowledge regarding pancreatic steatosis and its role in carcinogenesis and proposes future research directions to elucidate the possible mechanisms underlying other obesity-associated cancers.\",\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Sarcopenia is associated with complications and inferior oncologic outcomes in solid tumors. Axial computed tomography (CT) scans can be used to evaluate sarcopenia, however manual quantification is laborious. We sought to validate an automated method of quantifying muscle cross-sectional area (CSA) in patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC). METHODS: Mid-L3 CT images from patients with PDAC were analyzed: CSAs of skeletal muscle (SM) were measured using manual segmentation and the software AutoMATiCA, and then compared with linear regression. RESULTS: Five-hundred-twenty-five unique scans were analyzed. There was robust correlation between manual and automated segmentation for L3 CSA (R(2) 0.94, P < 0.001). Bland-Altman analysis demonstrated a consistent overestimation of muscle CSA by AutoMATiCA with a mean difference of 5.7%. A correction factor of 1.06 was validated using a unique test dataset of 36 patients with non-PDAC peripancreatic malignancies. CONCLUSIONS: Automated muscle CSA measurement with AutoMATiCA is highly efficient and yields results highly correlated with manual measurement. These findings support the potential use of high-throughput sarcopenia analysis with abdominal CT scans for both clinical and research purposes.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Background: Transient receptor potential channels (TRPs) have been demonstrated to take on functions in pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD) biology. However, little data are available that validate the potential of TRP in a clinical translational setting. Methods: A TRPs-related gene signature was constructed based on the Cox regression using a TCGA-PAAD cohort and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) was used to evaluate the predictive ability of this model. Core genes of the signature were screened by a protein-to-protein interaction (PPI) network, and expression validated by two independent datasets. The mutation analysis and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) were conducted. Virtual interventions screening was performed to discover substance candidates for the identified target genes. Results: A four TRPs-related gene signature, which contained MCOLN1, PKD1, TRPC3, and TRPC7, was developed and the area under the curve (AUC) was 0.758. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that patients with elevated signature score classify as a high-risk group featuring significantly shorter recurrence free survival (RFS) time, compared to the low-risk patients (p < 0.001). The gene prediction model also had a good predictive capability for predicting shortened overall survival (OS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) (AUC = 0.680 and AUC = 0.739, respectively). GSEA enrichment revealed the core genes of the signature, TRPC3 and TRPC7, were involved in several cancer-related pathways. TRPC3 mRNA is elevated in cancer tissue compared to control tissue and augmented in tumors with lymph node invasion compared to tumors without signs of lymph node invasion. Virtual substance screening of FDA approved compounds indicates that four small molecular compounds might be potentially selective not only for TRPC3 protein but also as a potential binding partner to TRPC7 protein. Conclusions: Our computational pipeline constructed a four TRP-related gene signature that enables us to predict clinical prognostic value of hitherto unrecognized biomarkers for PAAD. Sensory ion channels TRPC3 and TRPC7 could be the potential therapeutic targets in pancreatic cancer and TRPC3 might be involved in dysregulating mitochondrial functions during PAAD genesis.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Deterioration of diabetes control can be the first harbinger of pancreatic cancer. However, little is known about how to distinguish patients with pancreatic cancer-related diabetes deterioration from those with type 2 diabetes progression. We aimed to characterize the glycated hemoglobin (HbA(1c)) and body weight profile of pancreatic cancer patients with deteriorating diabetes before the cancer diagnosis. METHODS: Using data from the UK-based Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) GOLD, we established a study population including pancreatic cancer patients with diabetes deterioration in the >0.5-3 years before the cancer diagnosis and non-cancer patients with deterioration of type 2 diabetes (comparison group). Patients were considered to have diabetes deterioration if their glucose-lowering treatment was intensified. We characterized the longitudinal trajectories of HbA(1c) and body weight in pancreatic cancer patients compared with non-cancer patients before and after treatment intensification. RESULTS: The mean absolute increase in HbA(1c) from the pre-deterioration period, i.e. the time >1-2 years before treatment intensification, to the time of treatment intensification, was 1.5% +/- 1.6% in pancreatic cancer patients vs. 0.9% +/- 1.4% in non-cancer patients. After treatment intensification, mean HbA(1c) remained elevated in pancreatic cancer patients, while it returned to the pre-deterioration level in non-cancer patients. Body weight decreased by 1.9% +/- 6.4% in cancer patients and increased by 0.3% +/- 5.2% in non-cancer patients between the pre-deterioration period and treatment intensification, on average. CONCLUSIONS: Pancreatic cancer-related diabetes deterioration may frequently be characterized by pronounced increases in HbA(1c), persistent elevation of HbA(1c) after treatment intensification, and concomitant weight loss.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Accumulating evidence has demonstrated the essential role of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in various types of human cancer, including pancreatic cancer (PC). However, the functions and regulatory mechanisms of nuclear receptor subfamily 2 group F member 1 antisense RNA 1 (NR2F1-AS1) that are responsible for its role in the malignant progression of PC cells remains to be investigated. In this study, the biological effects of NR2F1-AS1 and NR2F1 in PC were investigated by in vitro and in vivo experiments. The mechanisms of NR2F1-AS1 were monitored by bioinformatic predictive analysis and confirmatory experiments. Our results indicated that NR2F1-AS1 was overexpressed and positively correlated with poor survival in PC. Depletion of NR2F1-AS1 restrained PC cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and suppressed xenograft tumor growth and metastasis in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistic experiments suggested that NR2F1-AS1 positively regulated the neighboring NR2F1 gene, which subsequently activated AKT/mTOR signaling, resulting in the upregulation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha). Further investigations elucidated that NR2F1-AS1 expression was transcriptionally regulated by HIF-1alpha under hypoxia. These findings demonstrated that hypoxia-induced NR2F1-AS1 expression directly increased NR2F1 levels to promote PC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion by activating AKT/mTOR signaling. Together, these findings suggest that NR2F1-AS1 could be a prospective therapeutic target for PC.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Cachexia occurs in up to 80% of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients and is characterized by unintentional weight loss and tissue wasting. To understand the metabolic changes that occur in PDAC-associated cachexia, we compared the abundance of plasma fatty acids (FAs), measured by gas chromatography, of subjects with treatment-naive metastatic PDAC with or without cachexia, defined as a loss of > 2% weight and evidence of sarcopenia (n = 43). The abundance of saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated FAs was not different between subjects with cachexia and those without. Oleic acid was significantly higher in subjects with cachexia (p = 0.0007) and diabetes (p = 0.015). Lauric (r = 0.592, p = 0.0096) and eicosapentaenoic (r = 0.564, p = 0.015) acids were positively correlated with age in cachexia patients. Subjects with diabetes (p = 0.021) or both diabetes and cachexia (p = 0.092) had low palmitic:oleic acid ratios. Linoleic acid was lower in subjects with diabetes (p = 0.018) and correlated with hemoglobin (r = 0.519, p = 0.033) and albumin (r = 0.577, p = 0.015) in subjects with cachexia.

       "  'AB': \"PURPOSE: Lifestyle factors such as smoking, alcohol, body weight, physical activity, and diet quality have been associated with the risk of pancreatic cancer. However, studies of their combined association in women are limited. METHODS: Data on smoking habits, alcohol intake, diet composition, recreational physical activity, body weight, and waist circumference, obtained at recruitment for 136,945 postmenopausal women (aged 50-79 years) participating in the Women's Health Initiative study, were categorized separately, with higher scores for each variable assigned to the categories representing healthier behaviors. The combined healthy lifestyle index (HLI) score, created by summing the scores for each risk factor, was grouped into quartiles. We used multivariable-adjusted Cox regression to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for pancreatic cancer risk in association with the HLI. RESULTS: Over an average follow-up period of approximately 16.0 years, 1,119 incident cases of pancreatic cancer were ascertained. Compared to women in the lowest HLI quartile, those in the upper quartiles (qt) had a reduced risk of pancreatic cancer (multivariable-adjusted HRqt(3)(rd) 0.83, 95% CI 0.74-0.99; and HRqt(4)(th) 0.74, 95% CI 0.62-0.88, respectively, p trend = 0.001). Use of waist circumference instead of BMI in the HLI score yielded similar results. Among women who were either non-diabetic or non-smokers, high HLI was also associated with reduced risk (HRqt(4)(th) 0.78, 95% CI 0.65-0.85 and HRqt(4)(th) 0.80, 95% CI 0.66-0.97, respectively). Stratification by BMI categories (18.5- < 25.0, 25.0- < 30.0 and > 30.0 kg/m(2)) showed similar results in all groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that in postmenopausal women, a healthy lifestyle is associated with reduced risk of pancreatic cancer.\",\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND & AIMS: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has a hypoxic, immunosuppressive stroma that contributes to its resistance to immune checkpoint blockade therapies. The hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) mediate the cellular response to hypoxia, but their role within the PDAC tumor microenvironment remains unknown. METHODS: We used a dual recombinase mouse model to delete Hif1alpha or Hif2alpha in alpha-smooth muscle actin-expressing cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) arising within spontaneous pancreatic tumors. The effects of CAF HIF2alpha expression on tumor progression and composition of the tumor microenvironment were evaluated by Kaplan-Meier analysis, reverse transcription quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, histology, immunostaining, and by both bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing. CAF-macrophage crosstalk was modeled ex vivo using conditioned media from CAFs after treatment with hypoxia and PT2399, an HIF2 inhibitor currently in clinical trials. Syngeneic flank and orthotopic PDAC models were used to assess whether HIF2 inhibition improves response to immune checkpoint blockade. RESULTS: CAF-specific deletion of Hif2alpha, but not Hif1alpha, suppressed PDAC tumor progression and growth, and improved survival of mice by 50% (n = 21-23 mice/group, Log-rank P = .0009). Deletion of CAF-HIF2 modestly reduced tumor fibrosis and significantly decreased the intratumoral recruitment of immunosuppressive M2 macrophages and regulatory T cells. Treatment with the clinical HIF2 inhibitor PT2399 significantly reduced in vitro macrophage chemotaxis and M2 polarization, and improved tumor responses to immunotherapy in both syngeneic PDAC mouse models. CONCLUSIONS: Together, these data suggest that stromal HIF2 is an essential component of PDAC pathobiology and is a druggable therapeutic target that could relieve tumor microenvironment immunosuppression and enhance immune responses in this disease.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND & AIMS: Pancreatic cancer has the highest prevalence of cancer-associated cachexia among all cancers. ZIP4 promotes pancreatic cancer progression by regulating oncogenic miR-373, and perturbation of circular RNAs (circRNAs) is associated with cancer aggressiveness. This study aimed to identify circRNAs involved in ZIP4/miR-373-driven cancer growth and cachexia and decipher the underlying mechanism. METHODS: Differentially expressed circRNAs and potential targets of microRNA were identified through in silico analysis. The RNA interactions were determined by means of biotinylated microRNA pulldown, RNA immunoprecipitation, and luciferase reporter assays. The function of circRNA in ZIP4-miR-373 signaling axis were examined in human pancreatic cancer cells, 3-dimensional spheroids and organoids, mouse models, and clinical specimens. Mouse skeletal muscles were analyzed by means of histology. RESULTS: We identified circANAPC7 as a sponge for miR-373, which inhibited tumor growth and muscle wasting in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistic studies showed that PHLPP2 is a downstream target of ZIP4/miR-373. CircANAPC7 functions through PHLPP2-mediated dephosphorylation of AKT, thus suppressing cancer cell proliferation by down-regulating cyclin D1 and inhibiting muscle wasting via decreasing the secretion of transforming growth factor-beta through STAT5. We further demonstrated that PHLPP2 induced dephosphorylation of CREB, a zinc-dependent transcription factor activated by ZIP4, thereby forming a CREB-miR-373-PHLPP2 feed-forward loop to regulate tumor progression and cancer cachexia. CONCLUSION: This study identified circANAPC7 as a novel tumor suppressor, which functions through the CREB-miR-373-PHLPP2 axis, leading to AKT dephosphorylation, and cyclin D1 and transforming growth factor-beta down-regulation to suppress tumor growth and muscle wasting in pancreatic cancer.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Purpose: Most patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) have vascular invasion and metastasis, leading to low surgical resection rate and dismal prognosis. Tumor angiogenesis is related to vascular invasion and metastasis. However, anti-angiogenesis therapeutic effects in PDAC are limited. Therefore, it is imperative to explore molecular mechanism of angiogenesis in PDAC. Experimental Design: scRNA-seq data were utilized to delineatetranscriptional profiles of endothelial cells in PDAC. The in vitro and vivo angiogenesis models were used to explore the role of PDAC derived exosomes under hypoxic condition in tumor angiogenesis. Results: Endothelial cells in PDAC had distinct gene expression profiles compared with normal pancreas. The marker genes of endothelial cells in PDAC were enriched for hypoxia and angiogenesis. MiR-30b-5p were significantly enriched in hypoxic PDAC cells derived exosomes, which could be transferred to HUVEC, resulting in the upregulation of miR-30b-5p. Hypoxic PDAC cells derived exosomes could promote tube formation and endothelial cells migration via miR-30b-5p mediated downregulation of gap junction protein GJA1. Moreover, hypoxic PDAC cells derived exosomes increased new microvascular density in vivo. Patients with PDAC had higher levels of total miR-30b-5p and exosomal miR-30b-5p in peripheral blood plasma than healthy subjects. In addition, there were significant correlations for the levels of total miR-30b-5p or exosomal miR-30b-5p between peripheral blood plasma and portal vein plasma. Conclusions: Hypoxic PDAC cells derived exosomal miR-30b-5p promoted angiogenesis by inhibiting GJA1, and miR-30b-5p was a potential diagnostic marker for PDAC.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'OBJECTIVE: To analyze the clinical characteristics of patients with pancreatic cancer (PC) and diabetes and to explore the impact of diabetes duration, weight loss, and hypoglycemic drugs on the tumor biological behavior of PC. METHODS: This is a retrospective study on patients with PC and diabetes. Subjects were grouped according to the onset age of PC, distant metastasis, duration of diabetes, degree of weight loss (∆Wt), and type of hypoglycemic drugs. Logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the association between diabetes duration, weight loss, hypoglycemic drugs, and early-onset PC, distant metastasis. RESULTS: Compared with late-onset PC, patients with early-onset PC had a higher proportion of new-onset DM (35 [79.5%] vs. 217 [46.9%], p < 0.001), smoker, drinker, and more obvious weight loss (8.5 [3.8, 15] kg vs. 5 [0, 10] kg, p < 0.001). Patients with remote metastasis had an earlier diagnosis age, heavier weight loss, lower body mass index, and were more likely to be smokers but had cancer less likely to be localized in the head of pancreas. Regression analysis showed that new-onset diabetes and weight loss were independently correlated to early-onset PC: odds ratio (OR) = 3.38 (95% CI 1.36-8.4, p = 0.09; OR = 1.56 (95% CI 1.16-2.1), p = 0.003, respectively. In contrast, long-term diabetes, and heavy weight loss were independently associated with remote metastasis: OR = 3.38 (95% CI 1.36-8.4, p = 0.09; OR = 1.56 (95% CI 1.16-2.1), p = 0.003, respectively. CONCLUSION: New-onset diabetes and weight loss were common presentation and risk factors of early-onset PC, which required more attention. Long-term diabetes and heavy weight loss were risk factors contributing to distant metastases, indicating potential risk factors contributing to the adverse prognosis of patients with PC.',\n",

BACKGROUND: Detecting PDAC at the early stage is challenging as the disease either remains asymptomatic or presents nonspecific symptoms. Risk prediction of PDAC is an efficient strategy as subsequent targeted screening can assist in diagnosing cancer at the early stage even before the symptoms appear. However, the lack of specific clinical and epidemiological predictors of PDAC makes prediction a highly challenging task. Detecting precursor changes in the pancreas can potentially assist in the risk prediction of PDAC as the precancerous pancreas evolves through biological adaptations-presented as morphological and textural changes on abdominal imaging. However, such microlevel \"clues\" usually remain unnoticed or unappreciated, partly due to the unavailability of tools to detect and interpret such complex measurements, making the risk prediction of PDAC an unresolved problem. METHODS: This review study highlights the limitations of the current risk prediction models of PDAC and the importance of abdominal imaging for predicting PDAC. A suggestive narrative is made as to how recent AI tools can assist in extracting precise measurements of biomarkers, detecting early signs and precancerous abnormalities, quantifying tissue characteristics, and revealing complex features potentially indicative of future incidence of pancreatic cancer (PC) using abdominal imaging. With the help of peer examples of other cancers, a case is built about the application of AI in utilizing image features of the pancreas to enhance risk prediction of PDAC. Furthermore, the challenges of AI applications including insufficient data for model training, risk of data privacy violation, inconsistent data labeling, and limited computational resources, and their potential solutions are also discussed. CONCLUSIONS: The recent advancement in the domain of AI is a potential opportunity to utilize automated tools for the identification of imaging-based indicators of PDAC and perform enhanced risk prediction of cancer. With this awareness and motivation, better management of PDAC has expected.',\n",

       "  'AB': \"Pancreatic cancer (PC) is the fourth leading cause of cancer mortality among women in the United States. Obesity is positively associated with PC risk. Current health recommendations focus on weight maintenance for healthy-weight individuals and weight loss for overweight/obese individuals; however, little research has assessed associations between PC risk and changes in weight throughout the life course. Using prospective cohort study data, we examined the relationship between baseline adulthood weight patterns self-reported between 1993 and 1998 and PC risk in 136,834 postmenopausal women with 873 incident PC cases through September 30, 2015, in the Women's Health Initiative. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using Cox proportional hazards models, adjusting for age, smoking habits, heavy alcohol consumption, and body mass index. Compared with women with stable weight, no significant associations were found between steady weight gain (HR = 1.01, 95% CI: 0.83, 1.22), sustained weight loss (HR = 1.26, 95% CI: 0.85, 1.87), or weight cycling patterns (HR = 1.08, 95% CI: 0.89, 1.30) and PC. Results were similar when the outcome definition was restricted to pancreatic adenocarcinoma cases. Overall, we did not find evidence to suggest that weight changes in adulthood significantly impact PC risk among postmenopausal women.\",\n",

       "  'AB': 'OBJECTIVE: Cancer cachexia is a devastating chronic condition characterized by involuntary weight loss, muscle wasting, abnormal fat metabolism, anorexia, and fatigue. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this syndrome remain poorly understood. In particular, the hypothalamus may play a central role in cachexia, given that it has direct access to peripheral signals because of its anatomical location and attenuated blood-brain barrier. Furthermore, this region has a critical role in regulating appetite and metabolism. METHODS: To provide a detailed analysis of the hypothalamic response to cachexia, we performed single-cell RNA-seq combined with RNA-seq of the medial basal hypothalamus (MBH) in a mouse model for pancreatic cancer. RESULTS: We found many cell type-specific changes, such as inflamed endothelial cells, stressed oligodendrocyes and both inflammatory and moderating microglia. Lcn2, a newly discovered hunger suppressing hormone, was the highest induced gene. Interestingly, cerebral treatment with LCN2 not only induced many of the observed molecular changes in cachexia but also affected gene expression in food-intake decreasing POMC neurons. In addition, we found that many of the cachexia-induced molecular changes found in the hypothalamus mimic those at the primary tumor site. CONCLUSION: Our data reveal that multiple cell types in the MBH are affected by tumor-derived factors or host factors that are induced by tumor growth, leading to a marked change in the microenvironment of neurons critical for behavioral, metabolic, and neuroendocrine outputs dysregulated during cachexia. The mechanistic insights provided in this study explain many of the clinical features of cachexia and will be useful for future therapeutic development.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND & AIMS: Pancreatic cancer (PC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related death with a 5-year survival rate of approximately 10%. It typically presents as a late-stage incurable cancer and chemotherapy provides modest benefit. Here, we demonstrate the feasibility, safety, and potency of a novel human natural killer (NK) cell-based immunotherapy to treat PC. METHODS: The expression of prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA) was evaluated in primary PC at messenger RNA and protein levels. The processes of retroviral transduction, expansion, activation, and cryopreservation of primary human NK cells obtained from umbilical cord blood were optimized, allowing us to develop frozen, off-the-shelf, allogeneic PSCA chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) NK cells. The safety and efficacy of PSCA CAR NK cells also expressing soluble (s) interleukin 15 (PSCA CAR_s15 NK cells) were evaluated in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS: PSCA was elevated in primary human PC compared with the adjacent or other normal tissues. PSCA CAR_s15 NK cells displayed significant tumor-suppressive effects against PSCA(+) PC in vitro before and after 1 cycle of freeze-thaw. The viability of frozen PSCA CAR_s15 NK cells persisted more than 90 days in vivo after their last infusion and significantly prolonged the survival of mice engrafted with human PC. CONCLUSIONS: PSCA CAR_s15 NK cells showed therapeutic efficacy in human metastatic PC models without signs of systematic toxicity, providing a strong rationale to support clinical development.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Approximately 80% of pancreatic cancer patients suffer from cachexia, and one-third die due to cachexia-related complications such as respiratory failure and cardiac arrest. Although there has been considerable research into cachexia mechanisms and interventions, there are, to date, no FDA-approved therapies. A major contributing factor for the lack of therapy options could be the failure of animal models to accurately recapitulate the human condition. In this study, we generated an aged model of pancreatic cancer cachexia to compare cachexia progression in young versus aged tumor-bearing mice. Comparative skeletal muscle transcriptome analyses identified 3-methyladenine (3-MA) as a candidate antiwasting compound. In vitro analyses confirmed antiwasting capacity, while in vivo analysis revealed potent antitumor effects. Transcriptome analyses of 3-MA-treated tumor cells implicated Perp as a 3-MA target gene. We subsequently (a) observed significantly higher expression of Perp in cancer cell lines compared with control cells, (b) noted a survival disadvantage associated with elevated Perp, and (c) found that 3-MA-associated Perp reduction inhibited tumor cell growth. Finally, we have provided in vivo evidence that survival benefits conferred by 3-MA administration are independent of its effect on tumor progression. Taken together, we report a mechanism linking 3-MA to Perp inhibition, and we further implicate Perp as a tumor-promoting factor in pancreatic cancer.',\n",

There are limited data concerning the prognostic effect of cachexia on second-line chemotherapy (L2). We aimed to assess the impact of cachexia progression during first-line therapy (L1) on survival after L2. METHODS: We reviewed patients with gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel (GEM/nabPTX)-refractory APC who underwent L2 with modified FOLFIRINOX or S-1 between 2015 and 2019 in our institution. We determined clinicopathological data including body composition parameters: subcutaneous fat area (SFA), visceral fat area (VFA), and skeletal muscle index (SMI). Correlations of changes in these parameters, as well as their effect on overall survival after L2 (OS2), were examined. RESULTS: Median rates of change in SMI, SFA, and VFA were 0.19%, -4.17%, and -18.39%, respectively, in 59 patients during L1. Although there was moderate correlation in rate of change between SFA and VFA, there was no correlation between SMI and other parameters. We defined loss of SFA, VFA, and SMI as decreases greater than 8.5%, 34.1%, and 8.7%, respectively. Median OS2 of patients with loss in any of these parameters was significantly shorter than in patients without loss (3.83 vs. 8.73 months). Multivariate analysis revealed that loss in any parameters, performance status, and C-reactive protein/albumin ratio were independent negative prognostic factors. CONCLUSION: Loss of adipose tissue or skeletal muscle during L1 had a considerable impact on OS2 in APC refractory to GEM/nabPTX.',\n",

A population pharmacokinetic (PK) model was developed based on data from seven studies (N = 440). Adequacy of the model was assessed using multiple methods, including visual predictive check. Associations between PK exposure and the incidence of diarrhea (grade >/=3) and neutropenia adverse events (AEs) (grade >/=3) at first event in patients with metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (mPDAC) were investigated using logistic regression based on data from two studies (the phase III NAPOLI-1 [N = 260] and phase I/II NCT02551991 [N = 56] trials). The PKs of total irinotecan was described by a two-compartment model with first-order elimination, with SN-38 formed directly by a first-order constant from the central compartment of irinotecan or after using a transit compartment. Clearance was 17.9 L/week (0.107 L/h) and 19,800 L/week (118 L/h) for total irinotecan and SN-38, respectively. The UGT1A1*28 7/7 homozygous genotype had no significant impact on SN-38 clearance. Model evaluation was satisfactory for both irinotecan and SN-38. The incidence of diarrhea (grade >/=3) at first event was significantly higher with increasing average concentrations of total irinotecan and SN-38; there was no significant association between an increased risk of neutropenia AEs (grade >/=3) at first event and average SN-38 concentrations. In summary, the PKs of total irinotecan and SN-38 after administration of liposomal irinotecan were well-described by the model. The UGT1A1*28 status had no significant impact on the PKs of liposomal irinotecan.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most lethal forms of cancer and is known to have low immunogenicity and an immunosuppressive microenvironment. It is also characterized by high accumulation of dense stroma, composed of mostly cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Multiple subsets of CAFs are described, with one of them expressing the transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta co-receptor endoglin. In previous work, we and others have shown that endoglin-expressing CAFs stimulate tumor progression and metastasis. Therefore, in this study, we set out to investigate the role of endoglin-expressing CAFs in pancreatic cancer progression. METHODS: First, we investigated the expression of endoglin on CAFs in both human tissues as well as a mouse model for PDAC. Since CAF-specific endoglin expression was high, we targeted endoglin by using the endoglin neutralizing antibody TRC105 in the murine KPC model for PDAC. RESULTS: Although some signs of immune activation were observed, TRC105 did not affect tumor growth. Since 90% of the CD8+ T-cells expressed the immune checkpoint PD-1, we investigated the combination with a PD1 checkpoint inhibitor, which did not enhance therapeutic responses. Finally, genetic deletion of endoglin from collagen 1a1 expressing cells also did not affect the growth of the mouse KPC tumors. CONCLUSION: Our results show that although endoglin is highly expressed on PDAC-CAFs and signaling is efficiently inhibited by TRC105, this does not result in decreased tumor growth in the KPC model for pancreatic cancer.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Trace elements such as cadmium, arsenic, zinc or selenium increase or decrease risk of a wide range of human diseases. Their levels in toenails may provide a measure of mid-term intake of trace elements for studies in humans. However, in biologically and clinically aggressive diseases as pancreatic cancer, the progression of the disease could modify such concentrations and produce reverse causation bias. The aim was to analyze the influence of specific time intervals between several clinical events and the collection of toenails upon concentrations of trace elements in patients with pancreatic cancer. Subjects were 118 incident cases of pancreatic adenocarcinoma prospectively recruited in eastern Spain. Toenails were collected at cancer diagnosis, and soon thereafter interviews were conducted. Information on cancer signs and symptoms was obtained from medical records and patient interviews. Levels of 12 trace elements were determined in toenail samples by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. General linear models adjusting for potential confounders were applied to analyze relations between log concentrations of trace elements and the time intervals, including the interval from first symptom of cancer to toenail collection (iST). Toenail concentrations of the 12 trace elements were weakly or not influenced by the progression of the disease or the diagnostic procedures. Concentrations of aluminum were slightly higher in subjects with a longer iST (age, sex and stage adjusted geometric means: 11.44 vs. 7.75 microg/g for iST > 120 days vs. </= 40 days). There was a weak inverse relation of iST with concentrations of zinc and selenium (maximum differences of about 20 and 0.08 microg/g, respectively). Conclusions: concentrations of the trace elements were weakly or not influenced by the development of the disease before toenail collection. Only concentrations of aluminum increased slightly with increasing iST, whereas levels of zinc and selenium decreased weakly. Even in an aggressive disease as pancreatic cancer, toenail concentrations of trace elements may provide a valid measure of mid-term intake of trace elements, unaffected by clinical events and disease progression.

       "  'AB': 'Pancreatic cancer represents a very challenging disease, with an increasing incidence and an extremely poor prognosis. Peculiar features of this tumor entity are represented by pancreatic exocrine insufficiency and an early and intense nutritional imbalance, leading to the highly prevalent and multifactorial syndrome known as cancer cachexia. Recently, also the concept of sarcopenic obesity has emerged, making the concept of pancreatic cancer malnutrition even more multifaceted and complex. Overall, these nutritional derangements play a pivotal role in contributing to the dismal course of this malignancy. However, their relevance is often underrated and their assessment is rarely applied in clinical daily practice with relevant negative impact for patients\\' outcome in neoadjuvant, surgical, and metastatic settings. The proper detection and management of pancreatic cancer-related malnutrition syndromes are of primary importance and deserve a specific and multidisciplinary (clinical nutrition, oncology, etc.) approach to improve survival, but also the quality of life. In this context, the introduction of a \"Nutritional Oncology Board\" in routine daily practice, aimed at assessing an early systematic screening of patients and at implementing nutritional support from the time of disease diagnosis onward seems to be the right path to take.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Dairy product intake was suggested to reduce the risk of gastrointestinal cancers. This study investigated the association between dairy product intake and the risk of pancreatic cancer (PAC) using a prospective cohort study and meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies. First, we included 59 774 people aged 40-79 years from the Japan Collaborative Cohort Study (JACC Study). The Cox regression was used to compute the hazard ratios (HR) and 95 % CI of incident PAC for individuals who reported the highest intakes of milk, cheese and yogurt compared with not consuming the corresponding dairy products. Then, we combined our results with those from other four prospective cohort studies that were eligible after searching several databases, in a meta-analysis, using the fixed-effects model before evaluating publication bias and heterogeneity across studies. In the JACC Study, the highest v. no intakes of milk, cheese and yogurt were not associated with the reduced risk of PAC after a median follow-up of 13.4 years: HR (95 % CI) = 0.93 (0.64, 1.33), 0.91 (0.51, 1.62) and 0.68 (0.38, 1.21), respectively. The results did not significantly change in the meta-analysis: 0.95 (0.82, 1.11) for milk, 1.16 (0.87, 1.55) for cheese and 0.91 (0.79, 1.05) for yogurt. The meta-analysis showed no signs of publication bias or heterogeneity across studies. To conclude, consumption of milk, cheese and yogurt was not associated with the risk of PAC either in the JACC Study or the meta-analysis.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is characterized by progressive weight loss and nutritional deterioration. This wasting has been linked to poor survival outcomes, alterations in host defenses, decreased functional ability, and diminished health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in pancreatic cancer patients. There are currently no standardized approaches to the management of pancreatic cancer cachexia. This study explores the feasibility and efficacy of enteral tube feeding of a peptide-based formula to improve weight stability and patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in advanced PDAC patients with cachexia. METHODS: This was a single-institution, single-arm prospective trial conducted between April 2015 and March 2019. Eligible patients were adults (>18 years) diagnosed with advanced or locally advanced PDAC and cachexia, defined as greater than 5% unexplained weight loss within 6 months from screening. The study intervention included three 28 day cycles of a semi-elemental peptide-based formula, administered through a jejunal or gastrojejunal feeding tube. The primary outcome was weight stability at 3 months (Cycle 3), defined as weight change less than 0.1 kg/baseline BMI unit from baseline. Secondary outcomes included changes in lean body mass, appendicular lean mass, bone mineral density, fat mass, and percent body fat, as measured with a DEXA scan, HRQOL (EORTC QLQC30) and NIH PROMIS PROs assessed at each cycle. Daily activity (steps, distance, active minutes, heart rate, and sleep) were remotely monitored using a wearable activity monitor (Fitbit) over the 3 month study period. RESULTS: Thirty-six patients were screened for eligibility, 31 patients consented onto study and underwent jejunal tube placement, and 16 patients completed treatment: mean age 67 years (SD 9.3), 43.8% male. Among evaluable patients (n = 16), weight stability was achieved in 10 patients (62.5%), thus completing the trial early. Increases in lean body mass (1273.1, SD: 4078, P = 0.01) and appendicular lean mass (0.45, SD: 0.6, P = 0.02) were observed. Statistically significant improvements at Cycle 3 from baseline were also observed for QLQC30 role function [mean difference (MD): 20.1, P = 0.03], appetite (MD: 27.4, P = 0.02), and global health scores (MD: 13.3, P = 0.05) as well as for NIH PROMIS t-scores for depression (MD: -10.4, P = 0.006) and pain interference (MD: -7.5, P = 0.05). Objectively monitored (Fitbit) activity levels increased, although statistical significance was not reached. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that enteral nutrition support may improve weight stability, lean body mass, appendicular lean mass and PROs in PDAC patients with cachexia who completed treatment, representing a subsample of the study population. The feasibility and role of enteral feeding in routine care remain unclear, and larger and randomized controlled trials are warranted.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'PURPOSE: Association of the metal chelating portion of thiosemicarbazone with the cytotoxic activity of sigma-2 receptors appears a promising strategy for the treatment of pancreatic tumors. Here, we developed a novel sigma-2 receptor targeting thiosemicarbazone (FA4) that incorporates a moiety associated with lysosome destabilization and ROS increase in order to design more efficient antitumor agents. METHODS: The density of sigma receptors in pancreatic cancer cells was evaluated by flow cytometry. In these cells, cytotoxicity (MTT assay) and activation of ER- and mitochondria-dependent cell death pathways (mRNA expression of GRP78, ATF6, IRE1, PERK; ROS levels by MitoSOX and DCFDA-AM; JC-1 staining) induced by the thiosemicarbazones FA4, MLP44, PS3 and ACthio-1, were evaluated. The expression of autophagic proteins (ATG5, ATG7, ATG12, beclin, p62 and LC3-I) was also studied. In addition, the in vivo effect of FA4 in xenograft models with and without gemcitabine challenge was investigated. RESULTS: We found that FA4 exerted a more potent cytotoxicity than previously studied thiosemicarbazones (MLP44, PS3 and ACthio-1), which were found to display variable effects on the ER or the mitochondria-dependent pro-apoptotic axis. By contrast, FA4 activated pro-apoptotic pathways and decreased autophagy, except in MiaPaCa2 cells, in which autophagic proteins were expressed at lower levels and remained unmodified by FA4. FA4 treatment of PANC-1 xenografted mouse models, poorly responsive to conventional chemotherapy, significantly reduced tumor volumes and increased intratumor apoptosis compared to gemcitabine, with no signs of toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that FA4 exhibits encouraging activity in pancreatic cancer cells unresponsive to gemcitabine. These results warrant further investigation in patient-derived pancreatic cancers, and hold promise for the development of therapies that can more efficiently target the specific characteristics of individual tumor types.',\n",

       "  'AB': \"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an aggressive and extremely therapy-resistant cancer. It is estimated that up to 80% of PDAC patients present with cachexia, a multifactorial disorder characterized by the involuntary and ongoing wasting of skeletal muscle that affects therapeutic response and survival. During the last decade, there has been an increased interest in exploring dietary interventions to complement the treatment of PDAC and associated cachexia. Ketogenic diets (KDs) have gained attention for their anti-tumor potential. Characterized by a very low carbohydrate, moderate protein, and high fat composition, this diet mimics the metabolic changes that occur in fasting. Numerous studies report that a KD reduces tumor growth and can act as an adjuvant therapy in various cancers, including pancreatic cancer. However, research on the effect and mechanisms of action of KDs on PDAC-associated cachexia is limited. In this narrative review, we summarize the evidence of the impact of KDs in PDAC treatment and cachexia mitigation. Furthermore, we discuss key cellular mechanisms that explain KDs' potential anti-tumor and anti-cachexia effects, focusing primarily on reprogramming of cell metabolism, epigenome, and the gut microbiome. Finally, we provide a perspective on future research needed to advance KDs into clinical use.\",\n",

       "  'AB': 'Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a lethal malignancy. Its prevalence rate remains low but continues to grow each year. Among all stages of PC, metastatic PC is defined as late‑stage (stage IV) PC and has an even higher fatality rate. Patients with PC do not have any specific clinical manifestations. Most cases are inoperable at the time‑point of diagnosis. Prognosis is also poor even with curative‑intent surgery. Complications during surgery, postoperative pancreatic fistula and recurrence with metastatic foci make the management of metastatic PC difficult. While extensive efforts were made to improve survival outcomes, further elucidation of the molecular mechanisms of metastasis poses a formidable challenge. The present review provided an overview of the mechanisms of metastatic PC, summarizing currently known signaling pathways (e.g. epithelial‑mesenchymal transition, NF‑kappaB and KRAS), imaging that may be utilized for early detection and biomarkers (e.g. carbohydrate antigen 19‑9, prostate cancer‑associated transcript‑1, F‑box/LRR‑repeat protein 7 and tumor stroma), giving insight into promising therapeutic targets.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) represents a challenging pathology with very poor outcomes and is increasing in incidence within the general population. The majority of patients are diagnosed incidentally with insidious symptoms and hence present late in the disease process. This significantly affects patient outcomes: the only cure is surgical resection but only up to 20% of patients present with resectable disease at the time of clinical presentation. The use of \"omic\" technology is expanding rapidly in the field of personalised medicine - using genomic, proteomic and metabolomic approaches allows researchers and clinicians to delve deep into the core molecular processes of this difficult disease. This review gives an overview of the current findings in PDAC using these \"omic\" approaches and summarises useful markers in aiding clinicians treating PDAC. Future strategies incorporating these findings and potential application of these methods are presented in this review article.',\n",

       "  'AB': \"Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is an infectious agent influencing as much as 50% of the world's population. It is the causative agent for several diseases, most especially gastric and duodenal peptic ulcer, gastric adenocarcinoma and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma of the stomach. A number of other, extragastric manifestations also are associated with H. pylori infection. These include neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, demyelinating multiple sclerosis and Parkinson's disease. There is also evidence for a relationship between H. pylori infection and such dermatological diseases as psoriasis and rosacea as well as a connection with infection and open-angle glaucoma. Generally little is known about the relationship between H. pylori infection and diseases of the pancreas. Most evidence about H. pylori and its potential role in the development of pancreatic diseases concerns pancreatic adenocarcinoma and autoimmune forms of chronic pancreatitis. There is data (albeit not fully consistent) indicating modestly increased pancreatic cancer risk in H. pylori-positive patients. The pathogenetic mechanism of this increase is not yet fully elucidated, but several theories have been proposed. Reduction of antral D-cells in H. pylori-positive patients causes a suppression of somatostatin secretion that, in turn, stimulates increased secretin secretion. That stimulates pancreatic growth and thus increases the risk of carcinogenesis. Alternatively, H. pylori, as a part of microbiome dysbiosis and the so-called oncobiome, is proven to be associated with pancreatic adenocarcinoma development via the promotion of cellular proliferation. The role of H. pylori in the inflammation characteristic of autoimmune pancreatitis seems to be explained by a mechanism of molecular mimicry among several proteins (mostly enzymes) of H. pylori and pancreatic tissue. Patients with autoimmune pancreatitis often show positivity for antibodies against H. pylori proteins. H. pylori, as a part of microbiome dysbiosis, also is viewed as a potential trigger of autoimmune inflammation of the pancreas. It is precisely these relationships (and associated equivocal conclusions) that constitute a center of attention among pancreatologists, immunologists and pathologists. In order to obtain clear and valid results, more studies on sufficiently large cohorts of patients are needed. The topic is itself sufficiently significant to draw the interest of clinicians and inspire further systematic research. Next-generation sequencing could play an important role in investigating the microbiome as a potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for pancreatic cancer.\",\n",

       "  'AB': 'In locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC), the combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy is a widely used treatment option. We performed a pooled analysis, including an exploratory analysis for prognostic and predictive factors, of two phase 2 trials including 73 patients with LAPC, treated with gemcitabine and oxaliplatin (GEMOX) and hypofractionated tomotherapy. With a median follow-up of 36 months (range 1-65), median progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 10.2 (95% confidence interval [CI] 7.8-13.2) and 14.3 (95% CI 12.0-18.1) months, respectively. The overall resectability rate was 23.3% (95% CI 13.6-33.0), and the R0 resection rate was 13.7% (95% CI 5.8-21.6). In the multivariate analysis, ECOG performance status (PS) 0 and low levels of CA 19-9 were associated with improved OS and PFS. Concerning OS, log(CA19-9) resulted in a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.20 (95% CI 1.02-1.42), p = 0.027. For ECOG PS 0, HR was 1.00; for PS 1, HR was 2.69 (95% CI 1.46-4.96); for PS 2, HR was 4.18 (95% CI 0.90-19.46); p = 0.003. Low CA19-9 levels were also predictive for resection, with an odds ratio of 0.71 (95% CI 0.52-0.97), p = 0.034. In conclusion, GEMOX and hypofractionated radiotherapy is a treatment option in LAPC. Further studies are needed to identify differences in tumor biology, which may help to predict resectability and prognosis.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'In solid tumors, the development of vasculature is, to some extent, slower than the proliferation of the different types of cells that form the tissue, both cancer and stroma cells. As a consequence, the oxygen availability is compromised and the tissue evolves toward a condition of hypoxia. The presence of hypoxia is variable depending on where the cells are localized, being less extreme at the periphery of the tumor and more severe in areas located deep within the tumor mass. Surprisingly, the cells do not die. Intracellular pathways that are critical for cell fate such as endoplasmic reticulum stress, apoptosis, autophagy, and others are all involved in cellular responses to the low oxygen availability and are orchestrated by hypoxia-inducible factor. Oxidative stress and inflammation are critical conditions that develop under hypoxia. Together with changes in cellular bioenergetics, all contribute to cell survival. Moreover, cell-to-cell interaction is established within the tumor such that cancer cells and the microenvironment maintain a bidirectional communication. Additionally, the release of extracellular vesicles, or exosomes, represents short and long loops that can convey important information regarding invasion and metastasis. As a result, the tumor grows and its malignancy increases. Currently, one of the most lethal tumors is pancreatic cancer. This paper reviews the most recent advances in the knowledge of how cells grow in a pancreatic tumor by adapting to hypoxia. Unmasking the physiological processes that help the tumor increase its size and their regulation will be of major relevance for the treatment of this deadly tumor.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Pancreatic cancer (PC) is one of the most lethal cancers and is the eleventh most common cancer worldwide. This disease is characterized by an often-fatal evolution and a high burden of symptoms, particularly pain. Several studies have demonstrated that pancreatic cancer patients have a high prevalence of pain, with up to 82% of patients reporting pain, often requiring systemic strong opioids as mainstay treatment. This comprehensive review of pancreatic cancer related pain (PCRP), focuses on current mechanisms that lead to pain including regional invasion processes, as well as the local secretion of factors that sensitize nociceptive nerves. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to conduct a review of PCRP and provide updates on intrathecal drug delivery in PC therapeutic recommendations. STUDY DESIGN: We used a narrative review design. We present a novel perspective in the field of pain research by converging data from intrathecal drug delivery trials with previous elements of molecular pain research in PCRP. METHODS: The literature review relating to PCRP pathophysiology and intrathecal drug delivery systems (IDDS) was done with searches of English, French, and Spanish abstracts, using PubMed, Dynamed, EMBASE, SciELO, Uptodate, Google Scholar, and manual searches of the bibliographies of known primary and review articles from IDDS inception until August 2020. Different search strings based on MESH terms were used including: pain, chronic pain, cancer pain, prevalence, pathophysiology, pancreatic cancer, analgesia, invasive pain procedures, celiac plexus neurolysis, pancreatic neuropathy, intrathecal drug delivery, or a combination of these terms. A narrative review based on these sources was prepared. RESULTS: This paper reviews aspects related to pancreatic adenocarcinoma and PCRP prevalence and focuses on recent developments in pathophysiology with IDDS as a pain management strategy. We summarize the best available evidence regarding intrathecal therapy (IT) for PCRP management; 18 studies of IDDS including at least 236 PC patients are analyzed. LIMITATIONS: Some limitations include: IDDS studies heterogeneity regarding disease stage, patient population, and technical aspects, such as catheter placement and treatment regimen, do not allow integration of studies. CONCLUSION: This review analyzes both past and current literature with a critical analysis of findings and respective recommendations. Most studies of IDDS in PCRP evaluate outcomes on pain using one-dimensional pain scales, such as VAS. Other relevant results, such as performance status or quality of life, are not frequently reported. Burden of disease variables, such as cancer stage, location, and comorbidities, like depression and systemic analgesia co-prescription, are usually not presented in these studies. In the same way, most studies do not precisely inform IDDS titration and IT medication. These factors make integration of IDDS in PC studies difficult. Future studies regarding impact of IDDS on pain control on quality of life, in this particular population, may help clinicians in deciding the optimal time and approach for IDDS. The studies should report data on particular disease, comorbidities, and treatment regimens.',\n",

METHODS: We carried out a retrospective analysis of the imaging data of 61 patients with pancreatic mass lesions who were diagnosed based on postoperative pathology in our hospital from May 2013 to May 2020 and analyzed the image diagnostic value of the combination of 128-slice CT and 1.5T MRI-DWI. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the pancreatic duct dilatation, the bile duct dilatation, or the peripancreatic and retroperitoneal lymph node enlargement between the patients with pancreatic carcinoma and the patients with mass-forming pancreatitis (P > 0.05). Both the incidences of lobulation signs and peripancreatic vascular invasion in the patients with pancreatic carcinoma were higher than they were in the patients with mass-forming pancreatitis, and the mass calcification, pseudocyst, and pancreatic duct stone rates, the net enhanced CT values in the arterial and pancreatic parenchyma phases, and the ADC values in pancreatic carcinoma patients were lower than they were in the patients with mass-forming pancreatitis (P < 0.05). The pancreatic duct stone and right prerenal fascial thickening rates in the patients with pancreatic carcinoma were lower than they were in the patients with mass-forming pancreatitis (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: CT signs combined with the MRI-DWI technique and MRCP can improve clinical pancreatic cancer diagnostic sensitivity.',\n",

       "  'AB': \"PURPOSE: The presence of a sarcopenia adversely affects the prognosis of patients with pancreatic cancer. There is an emerging role for using computed tomography (CT) to calculate skeletal muscle index (SMI) and the presence of sarcopenia. The aim of this study was to assess if detecting 'computed tomographic sarcopenia' is feasible and can contribute to the management of patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC). METHODS: Patients diagnosed with LAPC referred for endoscopic ultrasound-guided biopsy (EUS-B) by our regional cancer network were identified. Age, body mass index (BMI), and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG-PS) were noted. CT images were analysed for SMI and the presence of sarcopenia. Decision outcomes on receiving chemotherapy or not were collected from the regional oncology database. RESULTS: In total, 51/204 (25%) patients with LAPC who underwent EUS-B were not given chemotherapy and received best supportive care (BSC) only. The prevalence of sarcopenia (p = 0.0003), age >/= 75 years old (p = 0.03), and ECOG-PS 2-3 (p = 0.01) were significantly higher in the patients receiving BSC only. Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that SMI was the only independent associated factor identifying patients with LAPC who were treated with BSC only and not chemotherapy after adjusting for age and ECOG-PS. CONCLUSION: Our study has shown that computed tomographic skeletal muscle analysis at the time of a diagnostic CT for patients with pancreatic cancer is feasible and can detect sarcopenia and malnourished patients who are much less likely to take up chemotherapy. These patients could be triaged to oncology assessment prior to EUS-B to avoid unnecessary investigations.\",\n",

       "  'AB': 'INTRODUCTION: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy or neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (NAC/NACRT) for resectable/borderline resectable pancreatic cancers was recently performed to improve clinical outcomes and led to good results, although it remains controversial whether NAC/NACRT is beneficial for resectable pancreatic cancer. A few recent studies revealed longer patency and lower cost related to the stent occlusion of a metal stent than those of a plastic stent during NAC/NACRT. It also remains controversial which type of self-expandable metal stent (SEMS) is the most suitable for patients with resectable/borderline resectable pancreatic cancer during NAC/NACRT: an uncovered SEMS (USEMS), a fully covered SEMS (FCSEMS) or a partially covered SEMS (PCSEMS). So far, two randomised controlled trials indicated that a USEMS and an FCSEMS were similar in preoperative stent dysfunction and adverse event rate. Thus, we aimed to verify the non-inferiority of a PCSEMS to a USEMS in this multicentre randomised controlled trial. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We designed a multicentre randomised controlled trial, for which we will recruit 100 patients with resectable/borderline resectable pancreatic cancer and distal biliary obstruction scheduled for NAC/NACRT from 13 high-volume institutions. Patients will be randomly allocated to the PCSEMS group or USEMS group. The primary outcome measure is the preoperative biliary event rate. Data will be analysed after completion of the study. We will calculate the 95% CIs of the incidence of preoperative biliary events in each group and analyse whether the difference between them is within the non-inferiority margin (10%). ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study has been approved by the institutional review board of Hokkaido University Hospital. The results will be submitted for presentation at an international medical conference and published in a peer-reviewed journal. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: UMIN000041737; jRCT1012200002.',\n",

       "  'AB': \"Skin signs in acute pancreatitis are well-known and frequently discussed manifestations accompanied by unfavorable prognoses although they may rarely appear in clinical and forensic medicine. In 2018, the district attorney's office ordered a forensic autopsy for a 74-year-old man with terminal stage pancreatic cancer. The autopsy was ordered based on accusations of the deceased's widow regarding alleged medical malpractice and poor hospital care. The widow filed a grievance about multiple unsuccessful attempts to draw blood from her husband in addition to a diaper dermatitis at the right groin. An autopsy and additional histological examinations were performed. After considering all findings, the diaper dermatitis was eventually assumed to be a Fox sign caused by acute pancreatitis, and the allegations of medical malpractice were refuted. This case led us to identify another case with suspected cutaneous manifestations in pancreatic disease. We performed immunohistochemical staining on those two cases and six control cases to examine whether there was detectable presence of pancreatic lipase and trypsin in the skin discolorations and whether it could be used as a feasible method to verify skin signs associated with pancreatitis. Based on our findings, a minor disseminated lipase and trypsin staining should be considered regular and is therefore not conclusive of a skin sign associated with pancreatitis. Moreover, trypsin does not seem to be as suitable as lipase for this suggested immunohistochemical method. Nevertheless, this method might be a useful addition for determining the origin of skin discoloration and verifying skin signs associated with pancreatitis.\",\n",

       "  'AB': 'Intratumoral hypoxia is a widely established element of the pancreatic tumor microenvironment (TME) promoting immune escape, tumor invasion, and progression, while contributing to treatment resistance and poor survival. Despite this critical role, hypoxia is underrepresented in molecular signatures of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) and concurrent investigations into the hypoxia-immune status are lacking. In this work a literature-based approach was applied to derive an eight-gene hypoxia signature that was validated in fourteen cancer cell lines and in a cohort of PDA. The eight-gene hypoxia signature was significantly associated with overall survival in two distinct PDA datasets and showed independent prognostic value in multivariate analysis. Comparative analysis of tumors according to their hypoxia score (high versus low) determined that tumors with high hypoxia were significantly less enriched in cytotoxic T-cells, and cytolytic activity. In addition, they had lower expression of cytokines and tumor inflammatory markers, pointing to the signature\\'s ability to discern an immune \"cold\", hypoxic TME. Combining the signature with an immune metric highlighted a worse survival probability in patients with high hypoxia and low immune reactivity, indicating that this approach could further refine survival estimates. Hypoxia as determined by our signature, was significantly associated with certain immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) biomarkers, suggesting that the signature reflects an aspect of the TME that is worth pursuing in future clinical trials. This is the first work of its kind in PDA, and our findings on the hypoxia-immune tumor contexture are not only relevant for ICI but could also guide combinatorial hypoxia-mediated therapeutic strategies in this cancer type.',\n",

       "  'AB': \"Recent studies have indicated that preoperative biliary drainage (PBD) should not be routinely performed in all patients suffering from obstructive jaundice before pancreatic surgery. The severity of jaundice that mandates PBD has yet to be defined. The evaluated paper examines the impact of PBD on intra-operative, and post-operative outcomes in patients initially presenting with severe obstructive jaundice (bilirubin >/=250 mumol/L). In this key paper evaluation, the impact of PBD versus a direct surgery (DS) approach is discussed. The arguments for and against each approach are considered with regards to drainage associated morbidity and mortality, resection rates, survival and the impact of chemotherapy and malnutrition. Concentrating on resectable head of pancreas tumors, this mini-review aims to scrutinize the authors' recommendations, alongside those of prominent papers in the field.\",\n",

       "  'AB': 'CLINICAL/METHODOLOGICAL ISSUE: Chronic pancreatitis (CP) is a long-lasting inflammation of the pancreas that changes the normal structure and function of the organ. There are a wide range of inflammatory pancreatic diseases, of which some entities, such as focal pancreatitis (FP) or \"mass-forming pancreatitis,\" can mimic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). As a consequence, a misdiagnosis can lead to avoidable and unnecessary surgery or delay of therapy. STANDARD RADIOLOGICAL METHODS: The initial imaging method used in pancreatic diseases is ultrasound due to its availability and low cost, followed by contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CE-CT), which is considered a workhorse in the diagnostic work-up of diseases of the pancreas. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and/or MR cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) can be used as a problem-solving tool to distinguish between solid and cystic lesions, and to rule out abnormalities in the pancreatic ducts, such as those associated with recurrent acute pancreatitis (AP) or to show early signs of CP. MRCP has essentially replaced diagnostic endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) in the initial assessment before any therapeutic intervention. PRACTICAL RECOMMENDATION: The following review article summarizes the relevant features of CT and MRI that can help to make the diagnosis of CP and to aid in the differentiation between focal pancreatitis and PDAC, even in difficult cases.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'INTRODUCTION: Compared to non-Hispanic Whites, Japanese Americans, Native Hawaiians, and African Americans have higher incidences of pancreatic cancer (PCa) that are not entirely explained by rates of obesity but may be explained by weight changes throughout adulthood. METHODS: The multiethnic cohort is a population-based prospective cohort study that has followed 155,308 participants since its establishment between 1993 and 1996. A total of 1,328 incident cases with invasive PCa were identified through 2015. We conducted separate multivariable Cox proportional hazards models for self-reported weight-change and BMI-change (age 21 to cohort entry) to determine the association with PCa risk, adjusting for potential confounders including weight or BMI at age 21. RESULTS: The mean age at cohort entry was 59.3 years (SD 8.9). An increased risk of PCa was associated with: 1) weight (HR per10 lbs = 1.06; 95% CI = 1.03-1.09) or BMI (HR per kg/m(2)  = 1.04; 95% CI = 1.02-1.05) at age 21; and 2) weight (HR per 10 lbs = 1.03; 95% CI = 1.01-1.05) or BMI (HR = 1.02; 95% CI = 1.00-1.03) at cohort entry. We found increased risk of PCa between weight (HR per 10 lbs = 1.03; 95% CI = 1.01-1.05) and BMI (HR per 5 kg/m(2)  = 1.08; 95% CI = 1.01-1.15) change from age 21 to baseline. There were significant interactions between race/ethnicity and weight (p = 0.008) or BMI (p = 0.03) at baseline, and weight (p = 0.02) or BMI (p = 0.02) change. Weight and BMI change through adulthood significantly increased the risk of PCa for Japanese Americans and Latinos, but not for African American, White, or Hawaiian participants. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that weight or BMI gain has a significant and independent impact on PCa risk, specifically among Latinos and Japanese Americans.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Involuntary weight loss related to cachexia is common in patients with advanced cancer, but the association between body composition changes and survival is still unclear in pancreatic cancer. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the clinical outcomes of 55 patients with advanced pancreatic cancer undergoing palliative therapy or best supportive care (BSC). The skeletal muscle index (SMI), visceral adipose tissue index (VATI), subcutaneous adipose tissue index (SATI), and visceral to subcutaneous adipose tissue area ratio (VSR) were calculated based on the cross-sectional area on two sets of computed tomography images obtained at cancer diagnosis and 1 month later before treatment. The prognostic value of body composition indexes at diagnosis and the changes in those indexes over 1 month was then evaluated. RESULTS: In total, 45 patients (81.8%) received chemotherapy, chemoradiation, or radiation therapy, whereas the remaining patients underwent BSC. There were 27 patients (49.1%) who had low SMI at cancer diagnosis. Univariate analysis showed no significant associations between the baseline body composition indexes including SMI, VATI, SATI, and VSR and survival. Meanwhile, male sex (HR, 2.79; 95% CI, 1.16-6.71, p = 0.022) and higher decrease in VATI over 1 month (HR, 2.41; 95% CI, 1.13-5.13, p = 0.023) were identified as independent risk factors for mortality in multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION: Rapid decline in VAT over 1 month is closely associated with poorer survival in unresectable advanced pancreatic cancer. A short-term assessment of body composition changes may be a rational approach to predict prognosis in these patients.',\n",

       "  'AB': \"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to understand whether enhanced CT can provide more information than unenhanced CT on diagnosis of sarcopenia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed the enhanced CT data of 45 patients of pancreatic cancer. Manual tracing of the psoas muscles was used for measuring the cross-sectional muscle areas and attenuation at umbilicus level; afterwards, PMI, PMD, and Delta PMD were calculated. RESULTS: In the unenhanced scanning, arterial, venous, and parenchymal phases of enhanced CT, PMI values were 6.905 +/- 2.170, 6.886 +/- 2.195, 6.923 +/- 2.239, and 6.866 +/- 2.218, respectively, and the difference was not statistically significant. The PMD values at different phases were 34.311 +/- 7.535, 37.487 +/- 7.118, 40.689 +/- 7.116, and 42.989 +/- 7.745, respectively, which were gradually increased, and the difference was statistically significant. Meanwhile, the PMD of arterial phase, venous phase, and parenchyma phase showed a linear correlation with PMD of unenhanced scanning phase. 31 patients had low PMD and 14 had normal PMD during the unenhanced scanning phase. With the addition of contrast agent, DeltaPMD values increased faster in the low PMD group than in the normal PMD group during the venous and parenchymal phases (7.048 +/- 3.067 vs 4.893 +/- 2.558; 9.581 +/- 3.033 vs 6.679 +/- 2.621; p < 0.05), which made the gap between PMD after contrast-enhancement vs. unenhanced scanning smaller. CONCLUSION: The use of contrast agent has no effect on the manually measured PMI values but can change the results of PMD. This change makes the difference of PMD in different enhancement phases smaller than that in plain scan phase and furthermore increases the examination cost; therefore, it is not recommended to use enhanced CT routinely with fixed dose administration of contrast agent for patients' assessment of PMI and PMD.\",\n",

       "  'AB': \"This review aimed at assessing current guidelines' methodological quality systematically for pancreatic cancer's diagnosis and to reveal the heterogeneity of the recommendations among the evaluated guidelines. A systematic search was conducted to find the latest guidelines for pancreatic cancer's diagnosis. The Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE II) tool was used to assess the qualified guidelines' feature. We extracted the main recommendations for the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer from the guidelines and performed a heterogeneity evaluation. The highest-level evidence that supported these recommendations was further extracted and analysed. Nine guidelines for the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer were included in this study. Four of the guidelines had an overall score of more than 60% and thus are recommended for clinical use. Further analysis of the heterogeneity of the main recommendations for the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer in the guidelines revealed that the recommendations vary greatly among the different guidelines. The main reasons for the great differences include the neglect of symptoms and signs, great differences in the items involved in recommendations for the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer, inconsistent recommendations for some indicators (carbohydrate antigen 19-9 and ERCP), the unreasonable citation of evidence, and the failure of some recommendations to provide evidence supporting the recommendations. For most recommendations, there was a low level of evidence and a dearth of high-quality study evidence. Recommendations for pancreatic cancer diagnosis have been significantly inconsistent over the past five years. The quality of the guidelines for diagnosing pancreatic cancer also varies. The improvement by the guideline creators of the factors that contribute to the differences mentioned above will be a shortcut to update the guidelines for the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer.\",\n",

       "  'AB': \"BACKGROUND: Skeletal muscle wasting (SMW) in cancer patients is associated with increased morbidity, mortality, treatment intolerance and discontinuation, and poor quality of life. This is particularly true for patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), as over 85% experience SMW, which is responsible for ~30% of patient deaths. While the established paradigm to explain SMW posits that muscle catabolism from systemic inflammation and nutritional deficiencies, the cause of death, and the cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible remain to be elucidated. To address this, we investigated the relationship between tumour burden and survival in the KCKO murine PDAC model. METHODS: Female C57BL/6J mice 6-8 weeks of age underwent orthotopic injection with KCKO-luc tumour cells. Solid tumour was verified on Day 5, post-tumour inoculation. In vivo, longitudinal lean mass and tumour burden were assessed via dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and IVIS imaging, respectively, and total body weight was assessed, weekly. Animals were sacrificed at a designated end point of 'failure to thrive'. After sacrifice, lower limb hind muscles were harvested for histology and RNA extraction. RESULTS: We found a strong correlation between primary tumour size and survival (r(2)  = 0.83, P < 0.0001). A significant decrease in lower limb lean mass was first detected at Day 38 post-implantation vs. no tumour controls (NTCs) (P < 0.0001). SMW was confirmed by histology, which demonstrated a 38%, 32.7%, and 39.9% decrease in fibre size of extensor digitorum longus, soleus, and tibialis anterior muscles, respectively, in PDAC mice vs. NTC (P < 0.002). Histology also revealed a 67.6% increase in haematopoietic cells within the muscle of PDAC mice when compared with NTC. Bulk RNAseq on muscles from PDAC mice vs. NTC revealed significant increases in c/ebpbeta/Delta, il-1, il-6, and tnf gene expression. Pathway analyses to identify potential upstream factors revealed increased adipogenic gene expression, including a four-fold increase in igfbp-3. Histomorphometry of Oil Red-O staining for fat content in tibialis anterior muscles demonstrated a 95.5% increase in positively stained fibres from PDAC mice vs. NTC. CONCLUSIONS: Together, these findings support a novel model of PDAC-associated SMW and mortality in which systemic inflammation leads to inflammatory cell infiltration into skeletal muscle with up-regulated myocellular lipids.\",\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Pancreatic cancer (PAC) is one of the most devastating cancer types with an extremely poor prognosis, characterized by a hypoxic microenvironment and resistance to most therapeutic drugs. Hypoxia has been found to be one of the factors contributing to chemoresistance in PAC, but also a major driver of the formation of the tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment. However, the method to identify the degree of hypoxia in the tumor microenvironment (TME) is incompletely understood. METHODS: The mRNA expression profiles and corresponding clinicopathological information of PAC patients were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, respectively. To further explore the effect of hypoxia on the prognosis of patients with PAC as well as the tumor immune microenvironment, we established a hypoxia risk model and divided it into high- and low-risk groups in line with the hypoxia risk score. RESULTS: We established a hypoxia risk model according to four hypoxia-related genes, which could be used to demonstrate the immune microenvironment in PAC and predict prognosis. Moreover, the hypoxia risk score can act as an independent prognostic factor in PAC, and a higher hypoxia risk score was correlated with poorer prognosis in patients as well as the immunosuppressive microenvironment of the tumor. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, we established and validated a hypoxia risk model that can be considered as an independent prognostic indicator and reflected the immune microenvironment of PAC, suggesting the feasibility of hypoxia-targeted therapy for PAC patients.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Most patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) suffer cachexia; some do not. To model heterogeneity, we used patient-derived orthotopic xenografts. These phenocopied donor weight loss. Furthermore, muscle wasting correlated with mortality and murine IL-6, and human IL-6 associated with the greatest murine cachexia. In cell culture and mice, PDAC cells elicited adipocyte IL-6 expression and IL-6 plus IL-6 receptor (IL6R) in myocytes and blood. PDAC induced adipocyte lipolysis and muscle steatosis, dysmetabolism, and wasting. Depletion of IL-6 from malignant cells halved adipose wasting and abolished myosteatosis, dysmetabolism, and atrophy. In culture, adipocyte lipolysis required soluble (s)IL6R, while IL-6, sIL6R, or palmitate induced myotube atrophy. PDAC cells activated adipocytes to induce myotube wasting and activated myotubes to induce adipocyte lipolysis. Thus, PDAC cachexia results from tissue crosstalk via a feed-forward, IL-6 trans-signaling loop. Malignant cells signal via IL-6 to muscle and fat, muscle to fat via sIL6R, and fat to muscle via lipids and IL-6, all targetable mechanisms for treatment of cachexia.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'The aim of this study was to examine the health-related effects of exercise in patients with pancreatic cancer (PanCa) through a systematic review of current evidence. Studies were obtained through searching PubMed, Web of Science, PsycINFO, Embase, CINAHL Plus, and Cochrane Library databases with additional hand searches. All intervention-based studies were included if it involved (1) adult patients with PanCa, (2) exercise training, and (3) findings in quality of life, cancer-related fatigue, psychological distress, and physical function. The review protocol was registered in PROSPERO: CRD42020154684. Seven trials described in 9 publications were included consisting of 201 patients with early-stage and advanced PanCa. Participants were required to perform supervised and/or home-based, low- to moderate-intensity resistance and/or aerobic exercise for 12 to 35 weeks or duration of neoadjuvant therapy. There were no exercise-related adverse events with a reported retention rate of 71% to 90% and exercise attendance of 64% to 96%. The programs were consistently associated with improvements in cancer-related fatigue, psychological distress, and physical function, with mixed effects on quality of life. Exercise training seems to be safe and feasible and may have a beneficial effect on various physical and psychological outcomes in patients with PanCa. Further work with rigorous study designs is required to consolidate and advance current findings.',\n",

       "  'AB': \"Lipocalin 2 (LCN2) was recently identified as an endogenous ligand of the type 4 melanocortin receptor (MC4R), a critical regulator of appetite. However, it remains unknown if this molecule influences appetite during cancer cachexia, a devastating clinical entity characterized by decreased nutrition and progressive wasting. We demonstrate that LCN2 is robustly upregulated in murine models of pancreatic cancer, its expression is associated with reduced food consumption, and Lcn2 deletion is protective from cachexia-anorexia. Consistent with LCN2's proposed MC4R-dependent role in cancer-induced anorexia, pharmacologic MC4R antagonism mitigates cachexia-anorexia, while restoration of Lcn2 expression in the bone marrow is sufficient in restoring the anorexia feature of cachexia. Finally, we observe that LCN2 levels correlate with fat and lean mass wasting and is associated with increased mortality in patients with pancreatic cancer. Taken together, these findings implicate LCN2 as a pathologic mediator of appetite suppression during pancreatic cancer cachexia.\",\n",

       "  'AB': 'Cancer cachexia is a multifactorial syndrome that is characterised by a loss of skeletal muscle mass, is commonly associated with adipose tissue wasting and malaise, and responds poorly to therapeutic interventions. Although cachexia can affect patients who are severely ill with various malignant or non-malignant conditions, it is particularly common among patients with pancreatic cancer. Pancreatic cancer often leads to the development of cachexia through a combination of distinct factors, which, together, explain its high prevalence and clinical importance in this disease: systemic factors, including metabolic changes and pathogenic signals related to the tumour biology of pancreatic adenocarcinoma; factors resulting from the disruption of the digestive and endocrine functions of the pancreas; and factors related to the close anatomical and functional connection of the pancreas with the gut. In this review, we conceptualise the various insights into the mechanisms underlying pancreatic cancer cachexia according to these three dimensions to expose its particular complexity and the challenges that face clinicians in trying to devise therapeutic interventions.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Cancer cachexia is a highly debilitating condition characterized by weight loss and muscle wasting that contributes significantly to the morbidity and mortality of pancreatic cancer. The factors that induce cachexia in pancreatic cancer are largely unknown. We previously showed that pancreatic adenocarcinoma upregulated factor (PAUF) secreted by pancreatic cancer cells is responsible for tumor growth and metastasis. Here, we analyzed the relation between pancreatic cancer-derived PAUF and cancer cachexia in mice and its clinical significance. Body weight loss and muscle weight loss were significantly higher in mice with Panc-1/PAUF tumors than in those with Panc-1/Mock tumors. Direct administration of rPAUF to muscle recapitulated tumor-induced atrophy, and a PAUF-neutralizing antibody abrogated tumor-induced muscle wasting in Panc-1/PAUF tumor-bearing mice. C2C12 myotubes treated with rPAUF exhibited rapid inactivation of Akt-Foxo3a signaling, resulting in Atrogin1/MAFbx upregulation, myosin heavy chain loss, and muscle atrophy. The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and body weight loss were significantly higher in pancreatic cancer patients with high PAUF expression than in those with low PAUF expression. Analysis of different pancreatic cancer datasets showed that PAUF expression was significantly higher in the pancreatic cancer group than in the nontumor group. Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas data found associations between high PAUF expression or a high DNA copy number and poor overall survival. Our data identified tumor-secreted circulating PAUF as a key factor of cachexia, causing muscle wasting in mice. Neutralizing PAUF may be a useful therapeutic strategy for the treatment of pancreatic cancer-induced cachexia.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) are important components of the tumor microenvironment in pancreatic cancer (PC) and contribute to its development and metastasis through mechanisms that remain incompletely characterized. Tumor hypoxia affects the function and behavior of PC and stromal cells, and can alter exosomal content to modify cell-cell communication. The present study explored the effects of exosomal miRNAs produced by hypoxia-preconditioned PSCs on the growth and metastatic potential of PC cells. Subcutaneous xenografts and liver metastasis mouse models revealed increased tumorigenic potential upon co-implantation of PC cells and PSCs as compared to PC cells alone. Screening miRNA profiles of mouse plasma exosomes and cultured PSCs, followed by miRNA overexpression and inhibition assays, enabled us to identify miR-4465 and miR-616-3p as prominent hypoxia-induced, PSC-derived, exosomal miRNAs promoting PC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Proteomics analysis of PC cells incubated with exosomes derived from hypoxic PSCs showed significant downregulation of PTEN. Dual-luciferase reporter assays and western blotting showed that both miR-4465 and miR-616-3p target PTEN and activate AKT signaling in PC cells. We conclude that hypoxia upregulates miR-4465 and miR-616-3p expression in PSC-derived exosomes. Following exosome uptake, these miRNAs promote PC progression and metastasis by suppressing the PTEN/AKT pathway.',\n",

METHODS: The clinical data of 36 AIP (AIP group) and 38 PC patients (PC group), who were admitted to our hospital from January 2013 to June 2020 and confirmed by surgical biopsy or hormone therapy, were retrospectively analyzed. Participants in both groups were examined by CT, the imaging signs of the 2 groups were analyzed, and the results of CT examination were compared. RESULTS: In the PC group, the density of the lesions on the CT scan was mostly reduced, the pancreas was not swollen, and the kidneys were not involved. The bile duct wall was thickened with a sausage-like appearance, enveloped edges were rare, blood vessels were invaded, lymph nodes were enlarged, and the pancreatic duct was truncated. The findings of the AIP group were the opposite. The difference in the proportion of participants with the above-mentioned CT features between the 2 groups was statistically significant (P<0.05). The shape of the lesions in the AIP group was mainly elongated, of uneven density, and the density of enhanced scanning was medium to high. The predominant shape of the lesions in PC participants was spherical, and the density was uniform. The enhanced scan was mainly low-density. The difference in shape and density between the 2 groups was also statistically significant (P<0.05). The CT values of the plain scan, intravenous phase, and delayed phase in the AIP group were significantly higher than those in the PC group (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The imaging signs of AIP and PC overlap. Examination with CT is of great value in the differential diagnosis between AIP and PC. Familiarity with and mastery of the CT signs of AIP and PC can help to improve the accuracy of clinical diagnosis and provide a reliable basis for patients' follow-up treatment.\",\n",

       "  'AB': 'PURPOSE: To compare the survival benefit, pain control and safety of low-power cumulative and traditional high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) for metastatic pancreatic cancer. METHOD: We retrospectively analyzed 55 patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer who received HIFU treatment between January 2008 and April 2014 in our department. 23 patients received low-power cumulative HIFU treatment (L group), 32 received the traditional HIFU treatment (T group). Performance status, cancer-related pain and serum biochemistry results were assessed before and after treatment. All patients were followed up until death. The survival rate and adverse events of the two groups were compared. RESULTS: The baseline characteristics of the two groups were generally well balanced (p > 0.05). The average KPS score after treatment was significantly improved in both groups compared with the baseline score. 36 patients exhibited tumor-related pain at baseline. The pain response rate was significantly higher in the L group (92.3%) than in the T group (52.2%) (p = 0.025). The median overall survival (OS) for the L group was 7.0 months, which was significantly longer than that of the T group (p = 0.000). The 3-month and 6-month survival rates were higher in the L group. The adverse events in both groups included abdominal pain, elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) and elevated amylase. The incidence was lower in the L group than in the T group. CONCLUSION: Compared with traditional HIFU treatment, low-power cumulative HIFU treatment showed a significantly higher pain relief rate and survival benefit with a better safety profile in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'PURPOSE: In pancreatic cancer treatment, hyperthermia can be added to increase efficacy of chemo- and/or radiotherapy. Gas in stomach, intestines and colon is often in close proximity to the target volume. We investigated the impact of variations in gastrointestinal gas (GG) on temperature distributions during simulated hyperthermia treatment (HT). METHODS: We used sets of one CT and eight cone-beam CT (CBCT) scans obtained prior to/during fractionated image-guided radiotherapy in four pancreatic cancer patients. In Plan2Heat, we simulated locoregional heating by an ALBA-4D phased array radiofrequency system and calculated temperature distributions for (i) the segmented CT (sCT), (ii) sCT with GG replaced by muscle (sCT(0)), (iii) sCT(0) with eight different GG distributions as visible on CBCT inserted (sCT(CBCT)). We calculated cumulative temperature-volume histograms for the clinical target volume (CTV) for all ten temperature distributions for each patient and investigated the relationship between GG volume and change in DeltaT(50) (temperature increase at 50% of CTV volume). We determined location and volume of normal tissue receiving a high thermal dose. RESULTS: GG volume on CBCT varied greatly (9-991 cm(3)). DeltaT(50) increased for increasing GG volume; maximum DeltaT(50) difference per patient was 0.4-0.6  degrees C. The risk for GG-associated treatment-limiting hot spots appeared low. Normal tissue high-temperature regions mostly occurred anteriorly; their volume and maximum temperature showed moderate positive correlations with GG volume, while fat-muscle interfaces were associated with higher risks for hot spots. CONCLUSIONS: Considerable changes in volume and position of gastrointestinal gas can occur and are associated with clinically relevant tumor temperature differences.',\n",

       "  'AB': \"BACKGROUND: Pregabalin is commonly used to relieve neuropathic pain. However, data are lacking on its efficacy for the treatment of chronic cancer pain. The purpose of this study was to determine the analgesic efficacy of pregabalin combined with morphine in the management of pancreatic cancer pain. METHODS: This study reviewed patients who were prescribed morphine and 150 mg/d pregabalin between 1 January 2017 and 10 November 2018 in our institute. The primary outcomes of this study were the average pain score and dose of morphine. Secondary outcomes included characters of breakthrough cancer pain, functional interference related to pain, anxiety/depression status, and incidence of treatment-related adverse events during the study. RESULTS: A total of 240 patients with pain related to pancreatic cancer were included in the study. The results showed that patients of both combination therapy group (pregabalin+morphine) and monotherapy group (morphine) achieved similar analgesic efficacy, demonstrated by NRS (2.4 +/- 0.9 vs. 2.6 +/- 0.9; combination vs. monotherapy) at the end of the study. Mean daily dose of morphine used in the combination group was significant lower compared to monotherapy group (39.5 +/- 16.0 mg vs. 61.5 +/- 19.3 mg, net difference 23.5, 95% CI: 18.4-28.6, p <  0.001). The change of functional interference score related to pain was significantly different between combination and monotherapy group (12.0 +/- 0.4 vs. 9.8 +/- 4.9; net difference, 2.3; 95% CI: 1.1-3.3; p < 0.001). Patients in combination therapy group had experienced shorter duration of breakthrough cancer pain than those in monotherapy group (X(2) p < 0.001, Cramer's V:0.36). The incidence of somnolence, dizziness, and cognitive dysfunction were significantly higher in the combination group compared to monotherapy group. No serious treatment-related side effects were observed. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study supported the use of pregabalin with morphine to relieve pain in patients of pancreatic cancer.\",\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Up to 80% of patients with pancreatic cancer experience abdominal and back pain. Although pharmacologic medications provide some relief, many report inadequate analgesia and adverse effects. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is a non-invasive physical modality and had been widely applied for pain relieving, yet no study has investigated the effectiveness of TENS for pain in pancreatic cancer. METHODS: Eligible patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to TENS group or control group. The primary outcome was percentage change of numerous rating scale (NRS) after treatment. Secondary outcomes included percentage change of analgesic medication consumption and effect on constipation and poor appetite. RESULTS: One hundred seventy-one patients were recruited (84 to control group and 87 to TENS group). NRS in TENS group has been largely decreased 77.9% right after treatment and 27.1% in 2 hours, before applying any analgesic medication, while that in control group was slightly downregulated right after treatment but gave a trend to increase at 1, 2, and 3 hours. When comparing both groups, pain was significantly well controlled without analgesic medication supplement in TENS group at 0 hour (difference in mean percent change in NRS = 50.0 [95% CI, 50-51.4], P < .01) and 3 hours (difference in mean percent change in NRS = 134.0 [95% CI, 130.0-142.7], P < .01) after treatment, and this analgesic effect last to 3 weeks after treatment cycle (difference in mean percent change in NRS = 22.5 [95% CI, 17.6-27.3], P < .01) without increase of analgesic medication consumption. CONCLUSIONS: TENS reduces pain without increase analgesic medication consumption in patients with pancreatic cancer pain. It provides an alternative therapy for pain in pancreatic cancer.

       "  'AB': \"BACKGROUND: Diabetes and cancer are both multifactorial diseases, and epidemiologic evidence indicates that diabetes may be associated with the incidence of certain types of cancer. In diabetes the risk of pancreatic cancer is increased significantly. However, whether certain diabetes treatment being related with the risk of pancreatic cancer remains unclear. In this report, we presented a case of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma in a diabetic patient in China after being treated with liraglutide, a novel glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analog. CASE REPORT: A 71-year-old Han Chinese man who had had a type 2 diabetes for 25 years presented at the endocrinology department with discomfort in the left upper quadrant of abdomen for 10 days. The patient's vital signs and laboratory findings were unremarkable except for the elevated level of carbohydrate antigen (CA19-9). The upper abdomen routine enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan showed low density of the pancreatic body and tail, and the histopathological result of the pancreatic biopsy samples was pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma with regional lymph node metastasis. We reviewed his former medical records and found that liraglutide was added to his hypoglycemic treatment regimen 20 months ago. At that time, the level of tumor biomarkers and upper abdomen routine CT were unremarkable. We estimated the causality between liraglutide and pancreatic cancer by the Naranjo Adverse Drug Reaction Probability scale and WHO-Uppsala Monitoring Centre (WHO-UMC) system, and the causality turned out to be possible. CONCLUSION: Our report suggests that liraglutide may be related with the genesis and development of pancreatic cancer and also highlights the importance of regular checkups in diabetic patients treated with liraglutide. However, our report has some notable limitations, and further longer-term follow-up trials with larger sample should be conducted in future to assess the causality between liraglutide and pancreatic cancer.\",\n",

PATIENTS AND METHODS: SEQUOIA, a randomized, global phase III study, compared FOLFOX with PEG + FOLFOX as second line in gemcitabine-refractory PDAC. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 (PEG + FOLFOX:FOLFOX) and stratified by prior gemcitabine and region. Eligible patients had only one prior gemcitabine-containing treatment. Primary end point was overall survival (OS). Secondary end points included progression-free survival (PFS), response evaluation per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor (RECIST) 1.1, and safety. Exploratory analyses included biomarkers related to immune activation. RESULTS: Between March 1, 2017, and September 9, 2019, 567 patients were randomly assigned PEG + FOLFOX (n = 283) or FOLFOX (n = 284). Most (94.7%) patients received prior gemcitabine plus nab paclitaxel. OS was similar comparing PEG + FOLFOX versus FOLFOX (median: 5.8 v 6.3 months; hazard ratio = 1.045; 95% CI, 0.863 to 1.265). Also, PFS (median 2.1 v 2.1 months; hazard ratio = 0.981; 95% CI, 0.808 to 1.190) and objective response rate (4.6% v 5.6%) were similar between the treatment arms. Most common (>/= 35%) treatment-emergent adverse events in PEG + FOLFOX versus FOLFOX were thrombocytopenia (55% v 20%), anemia (40% v 16%), fatigue (61% v 45%), neutropenia (39% v 28%), abdominal pain (37% v 29%), nausea (45% v 41%), neuropathy (37% v 38%), and decreased appetite (35% v 31%). Exploratory analyses revealed increases in total IL-18, interferon (IFN)-gamma, and granzyme B and decreases in transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta with the addition of PEG. CONCLUSION: PEG added to FOLFOX did not improve efficacy in advanced gemcitabine-refractory PDAC. Safety findings were consistent as previously observed from PEG with chemotherapy; toxicity was manageable and tolerable. Exploratory pharmacodynamic results were consistent with immunostimulatory signals of the IL-10R pathway.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'The antidiabetic adiponectin receptor agonist AdipoRon has been shown to suppress the tumour growth of human pancreatic cancer cells. Because obesity and diabetes affect pancreatic cancer progression and chemoresistance, we investigated the effect of AdipoRon on orthotopic tumour growth of Panc02 pancreatic cancer cells in DIO (diet-induced obese) prediabetic mice. Administration of AdipoRon into DIO mice fed high-fat diets, in which prediabetic conditions were alleviated to some extent, did not reduce either body weight or tumour growth. However, when the DIO mice were fed low-fat diets, body weight and the blood leptin level gradually decreased, and importantly, AdipoRon became effective in suppressing tumour growth, which was accompanied by increases in necrotic areas and decreases in Ki67-positive cells and tumour microvessels. AdipoRon inhibited cell growth and induced necrotic cell death of Panc02 cells and suppressed angiogenesis of endothelial MSS31 cells. Insulin and IGF-1 only slightly reversed the AdipoRon-induced suppression of Panc02 cell survival but had no effect on the AdipoRon-induced suppression of MSS31 cell angiogenesis. Leptin significantly ameliorated AdipoRon-induced suppression of angiogenesis through inhibition of ERK1/2 activation. These results suggest that obesity-associated factors weaken the anticancer effect of AdipoRon, which indicates the importance of weight loss in combating pancreatic cancer.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Circadian disruption may play a role in carcinogenesis. Recent research suggests that light at night (LAN), a circadian disruptor, may be a risk factor for cancer. Moreover, LAN has been linked to obesity and diabetes, two risk factors for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Here we examine the relationship between LAN and PDAC in an epidemiologic study of 464,371 participants from the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study. LAN was estimated from satellite imagery at baseline (1996), and incident primary PDAC cases were ascertained from state cancer registries. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate HRs and two-sided 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the association between quintiles of LAN and PDAC in the overall population stratified by sex. Over up to 16.2 years of follow-up, a total of 2,502 incident PDAC were identified in the cohort. Higher estimated LAN exposure was associated with an elevated PDAC risk. Compared with those living in areas in the lowest LAN quintile, those in areas in the highest quintile had a 27% increase PDAC risk [HR (95% CI), 1.24 (1.03-1.49)], with similar risk for men [1.21 (0.96-1.53)] and women [1.28 (0.94-1.75)]. In addition, stronger associations were observed in normal and overweight groups compared with the obese group (P (interaction) = 0.03). Our results support the hypothesis that LAN and circadian disruption may be risk factors for PDAC. SIGNIFICANCE: Our study suggests that higher LAN is a risk factor for pancreatic cancer, contributing to the growing literature that demonstrates the potentially adverse health effects of light pollution.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Hypoxia is a characteristic of the tumor microenvironments within pancreatic cancer (PC), which has been linked to its malignancy. Recently, hypoxia has been reported to regulate the activity of important carcinogenic pathways by changing the status of histone modification. NOX4, a member of NADPH oxidase (NOX), has been found to be activated by hypoxia and promote cancer progression in several cancers. But whether it is involved in the epigenetic changes of tumor cells induced by hypoxia is still unclear, and its biological roles in PC also need to be explored. METHODS: A hypoxic-related gene signature and its associated pathways in PC were identified by analyzing the pancreatic cancer gene expression data from GEO and TCGA database. Candidate downstream gene (NOX4), responding to hypoxia, was validated by RT-PCR and western blot. Then, we evaluated the relationship between NOX4 expression and clinicopathologic parameters in 56 PC patients from our center. In vitro and in vivo assays were preformed to explore the phenotype of NOX4 in PC. Immunofluorescence, western blot and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were further applied to search for a detailed mechanism. RESULTS: We quantified hypoxia and developed a hypoxia signature, which was associated with worse prognosis and elevated malignant potential in PC. Furthermore, we found that NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4), which was induced by hypoxia and upregulated in PC in a HIF1A-independent manner, caused inactivation of lysine demethylase 5A (KDM5A), increased the methylation modification of histone H3 and regulated the transcription of EMT-associated gene_ snail family transcriptional repressor 1 (SNAIL1). This served to promote the invasion and metastasis of PC. NOX4 deficiency repressed hypoxia-induced EMT, reduced expression of H3K4ME3 and impaired the invasion and metastasis of PC cells; however, knockdown of KDM5A reversed the poor expression of H3KEME3 induced by NOX4 deficiency, thereby promoting EMT. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the prognostic role of hypoxia-related genes in PC and strong correlation with EMT pathway. Our results also creatively discovered that NOX4 was an essential mediator for hypoxia-induced histone methylation modification and EMT in PC cells.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: The prevalence of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is on the rise, driven by factors such as aging and an increasing prevalence of obesity and diabetes mellitus. To improve the poor survival rate of PDAC, early detection is vital. Recently, pancreatic steatosis has gained novel interest as a risk factor for PDAC. This study aimed to investigate if pancreatic steatosis on computed tomography (CT) is an early imaging feature in patients with pre-diagnostic PDAC. METHODS: A retrospective case-control study was performed. Patients diagnosed with PDAC (2010-2016) were reviewed for abdominal non-contrast CT-imaging 1 month-3 years prior to their diagnosis. Cases were matched 1:4 with controls based on age, gender and imaging date. Unenhanced CT-images were evaluated for pancreatic steatosis (pancreas-to-spleen ratio in Hounsfield Units <0.70) by a blinded radiologist and results were compared between cases and controls. RESULTS: In total, 32 cases and 117 controls were included in the study with a comparable BMI (29.6 and 29.2 respectively, p = 0.723). Pancreatic steatosis was present in 71.9% of cases compared to 45.3% of controls (Odds ratio (OR) 3.09(1.32-7.24), p = 0.009). Adjusted for BMI and diabetes mellitus, pancreatic steatosis on CT remained a significant independent risk factor for PDAC (Adjusted OR 2.70(1.14-6.58), p = 0.037). CONCLUSION: Pancreatic steatosis measured on CT is independently associated with PDAC up to three years before the clinical diagnosis in overweight patients. If these data are confirmed, this novel imaging feature may be used to identify high-risk individuals and to stratify the risk of PDAC in individuals that already undergo PDAC screening.',\n",

       "  'AB': \"Pancreatic cancer (PC), with a 5 year survival of <7%, is one of the most fatal of all human cancers. The highly aggressive and metastatic character of this disease poses a challenge that current therapies are failing, despite significant efforts, to meet. This review examines the current status of the 35 small molecule inhibitors targeting pancreatic cancer in clinical trials and the >50 currently under investigation. These compounds inhibit biological targets spanning protein kinases, STAT3, BET, HDACs and Bcl-2 family proteins. Unsurprisingly, protein kinase inhibitors are overrepresented. Some trials show promise; a phase I combination trial of vorinostat 11 and capecitabine 17 gave a median overall survival (MoS) of 13 months and a phase II study of pazopanib 15 showed a MoS of 25 months. The current standard of care for metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, fluorouracil/folic acid (5-FU, Adrucil(R)), and gemcitabine (GEMZAR(R)) afforded a MoS of 23 and 23.6 months (EPAC-3 study), respectively. In patients who can tolerate the FOLFIRINOX regime, this is becoming the standard of treatment with a MoS of 11.1 months. Clinical study progress has been slow with limited improvement in patient survival relative to gemcitabine 1 monotherapy. A major cause of low PC survival is the late stage of diagnosis, occurring in patients who consider typical early stage warning signs of aches and pains normal. The selection of patients with specific disease phenotypes, the use of improved efficient drug combinations, the identification of biomarkers to specific cancer subtypes and more effective designs of investigation have improved outcomes. To move beyond the current dire condition and paucity of PC treatment options, determination of the best regimes and new treatment options is a challenge that must be met. The reasons for poor PC prognosis have remained largely unchanged for 20 years. This is arguably a consequence of significant changes in the drug discovery landscape, and the increasing pressure on academia to deliver short term 'media' friendly short-term news 'bites'. PC research sits at a pivotal point. Perhaps the greatest challenge is enacting a culture change that recognises that major breakthroughs are a result of blue sky, truly innovative and curiosity driven research.\",\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: To investigate the clinical impact of sarcopenia and skeletal muscle density (SMD) among patients with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma who underwent palliative first line gemcitabine-based chemotherapy. METHODS: A total of 330 patients treated with first line gemcitabine-based chemotherapy between January 2010 and March 2017 were included. CT scans before chemotherapy and after 8+/-2 weeks were evaluated. The L3 skeletal muscle index (SMI) was used to detect sarcopenia and calculated as the total area of the L3 skeletal muscle divided by the height-squared (cm2/m2). SMD was quantified as the mean muscle radiation attenuation of the muscle cross-sectional area across the L3 vertebral body level and was assessed between - 29 and + 150 Hounsfield units. RESULTS: A SMI to SMD comparison revealed a positive correlation (R2 = 0.058, P < 0.001). Compared with high SMD, the risks of low SMI were 1.516 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.164-1.973) among patients with low SMD. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the low SMD was related to poor overall survival (OS, median, 6.1 versus [vs.] 7.9 months, P = 0.010). Multivariate analysis using Cox regression showed that low SMI (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.35, 95% CI: 1.03-1.78, P = 0.032) and low SMD (HR: 1.45, 95% CI: 1.09-1.93, P = 0.011) were poor prognostic factors for OS, respectively. Co-presence of low SMI and low SMD had more powerful prognostic implication for OS (HR: 1.58, 95% CI: 1.12-2.23, P = 0.010). Grade 3 or higher toxicity of chemotherapy was more frequently observed in patients who have a low SMI (43% vs. 59%, P = 0.019) and low SMD (44% vs. 60%, P = 0.023). OS was not related to SMD status among patients who were chemotherapy responders (complete or partial responses). However, among non-responders (stable or progressive disease), low SMD groups had significantly poorer OS in comparison with high SMD groups (median, 5.6 vs 7.4 months, P = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: Sarcopenia and SMD status can be considered a prognostic factor in patients with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma who received palliative first line gemcitabine-based chemotherapy. Severe chemotherapy toxicity occurred in the sarcopenia and low SMD groups. Our data suggest that a comprehensive assessment of skeletal muscle parameters may be more useful prognostic factors.',\n",

Anamorelin was not approved for use in Europe. In contrast, the use of anamorelin for cancer cachexia in four types of cancer (non-small cell lung cancer, gastric cancer, pancreatic cancer, and colorectal cancer) was approved in Japan on 11 December 2020. Phase 2 trial (ONO-7643-04) for the treatment of patients with non-small cell lung cancer and cachexia resulted in 1.56 kg lean body mass increase assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Another study for advanced and unresectable gastrointestinal (colorectal, gastric, or pancreatic) cancer showed 1.89 +/- 0.36 kg improvement in lean body mass. Skeletal lean body mass assessed by DXA is important for diagnosing sarcopenia and cachexia in Asia. The approval of anamorelin is expected to change clinical practice of cancer cachexia in Japan and hopefully in other countries. In the past, cachexia was rarely diagnosed in Japan, because it was often thought that cachexia meant terminal stage. The dissemination of clinical findings on anamorelin from Japan, as well as the creation of consensus papers and clinical practice guidelines for cachexia in Japan and Asia, will be required to promote international expansion in the future.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'INTRODUCTION AND IMPORTANCE: Recent advances in chemotherapy and chemoradiotherapy allow performance of conversion surgery by improving tumor shrinkage in select patients with initially unresectable locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC), thereby providing curative potential. The number of conversion surgeries requiring arterial reconstruction for select patients with initially unresectable LAPC following favorable responses is expected to increase, so providing effective options for safe arterial reconstruction is critical. CASE PRESENTATION: Herein we report a case of successful conversion surgery for initially unresectable LAPC with splenic artery transposition for hepatic arterial reconstruction after gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel (GnP). A 71-year-old woman was referred to our hospital for evaluation of a pancreatic head mass after developing diabetes. She was diagnosed with unresectable LAPC, which was in wide contact with the common hepatic artery (CHA), proper hepatic artery (PHA), and splenic artery (SA). She received GnP, and after 6 cycles, durations of disease control and normalization of serum carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) exceeded 7 months. She underwent radical subtotal stomach-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy with CHA-PHA and portal vein (PV) resection (SA-right hepatic artery anastomosis/PV-superior mesenteric vein direct end-to-end anastomosis). Histopathological examination revealed R0 resection with a histological response of Evans grade IIB. No signs of tumor recurrence have been observed for 14 months postoperatively. CLINICAL DISCUSSION: No consensus has been reached regarding the optimal treatment regimen, duration, or criteria for conversion surgery in patients with LAPC, especially in cases requiring arterial resection. SA transposition for hepatic arterial reconstruction is generally very consistent, easily accessible, and offers adequate length and diameter for successful arterial anastomosis. CONCLUSION: Even for a SA initially in contact with the tumor, SA transposition for hepatic artery reconstruction is a safe and effective option when tumor contact disappears due to chemotherapy.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), which accounts for majority of pancreatic cancers, is one of the most lethal human malignancies. Most patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage after symptom development. Early diagnosis of PDAC in asymptomatic subjects is important to improve prognosis. Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a risk factor for PDAC, and DM, especially new-onset DM, has attracted attentions as a diagnostic clue to PDAC. However, the impact of DM as a diagnostic opportunity on the prognosis of PDAC is unclear. We here retrospectively reviewed 489 PDAC patients and compared the clinical characteristics and prognosis according to the opportunities for PDAC diagnosis. PDAC was diagnosed upon presentation of symptoms, such as pain and jaundice, in 318 cases including 151 DM patients, upon new-onset or exacerbation of long-standing DM in 53 asymptomatic patients, and upon incidental detection by medical check-up or follow-up/work-up of other diseases in 118 asymptomatic patients. Asymptomatic patients including those with DM had smaller tumors, earlier disease stage, and higher resectability rates than symptomatic patients. Asymptomatic patients diagnosed in association with DM had better prognosis (median survival time, 771 days) than those diagnosed due to symptoms (343 days, P < 0.001), and similar to those diagnosed by incidental detection (869 days). The survival advantage was not evident in symptomatic patients with DM-associated signs. In conclusion, patients diagnosed in association with DM at asymptomatic stages had better prognosis than those diagnosed with symptoms. DM-associated signs might provide a clue to the early diagnosis of PDAC among asymptomatic subjects.',\n",

       "  'AB': \"BACKGROUND: Head pancreatic cancers often present with clinical challenges requiring biliary drainage for chemotherapy or palliative scope. If usual endoscopic modalities fail or if percutaneous approach is not feasible, endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) guided biliary drainage can be considered. Here we describe and discuss an interesting clinical case in which EUS-guided gallbladder drainage (EUS-GBD) was chosen to treat acute severe cholangitis in a patient with advanced pancreatic cancer. CASE SUMMARY: An 84-year-old female with a previous EUS-biopsy proven diagnosis of head pancreatic cancer presented with clinical signs of acute cholangitis. In September 2018 she had positioned a biliary and duodenal stent to relieve jaundice and an initial duodenal substenosis. In the emergency ward, an abdominal computed tomography scan showed proximal biliary stent occlusion due to neoplastic progression, but endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was impossible because of worsening duodenal stenosis and the absence of a chance to reach the Vater's papilla area. EUS-guided choledocoduodenostomy was not technically feasible but because the cystic duct was free of neoplastic infiltration, an EUS-GBD using an Axios stent was successfully performed. The patient started to feed after 48 h and was discharged 1 wk later. No other hospitalizations due to cholangitis or symptoms of Axios stent occlusion/dysfunction were observed up until her death 6 mo later due to underlying disease. CONCLUSION: This case demonstrated how different EUS therapeutic approaches could have a key role to treat critical and seemingly unsolvable situations and that they could play a more fundamental role in the next future.\",\n",

Recently, an oxaliplatin-based chemotherapeutic regimen was adopted for advanced pancreatic cancer. Although oxaliplatin has extensive therapeutic potential, its use can be limited by significant adverse effects, particularly ototoxicity. This paper reports a rare case of irreversible unilateral hearing loss in a 48-year-old female that developed after the intravenous infusion of oxaliplatin during pancreatic cancer treatment. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the second reported case of oxaliplatin-related ototoxicity in pancreatic cancer.\",\n",

       "  'AB': 'Background: Patients with chronic pancreatitis (CP) have an increased risk of developing pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). We present data on PDAC in one of the most extensive European single-centre cohort studies of patients with CP. Methods: Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data of patients with CP was performed. Aetiology of CP was determined according to the M-ANNHEIM classification system and only patients with definite CP > 18 years at data analysis were included. The final dataset included 581 patients with definite CP diagnosed between 2003 and 2018. Results: At CP diagnosis, there were 371 (63.9%) males and 210 (36.1%) females (median age 57 years, range 2-86). During 3423 person-years of observation, six pancreatic cancers were diagnosed (0.2% year). The mean time between diagnosis of CP and the occurrence of PDAC was 5.0 years (range 2.7-8.6). None of the cancer patients had a family history of PDAC. Diabetes mellitus (DM) was present in five of six (83.3%) patients with PDAC: in three patients before and in two after CP diagnosis. Clinical/laboratory signs of pancreatic exocrine insufficiency (PEI) were present in five of six (83.3%) patients with PDAC: in two at diagnosis of CP and in three after diagnosis. The mean survival time was 4 months after the diagnosis of PDAC (range 0.5-13). PDAC occurred significantly more often (p < 0.001) in two groups of patients without previous acute pancreatitis (AP): 2 of 20 patients (10%) with low body mass index (BMI) and PEI and in 3 of 10 (30%) patients with high BMI and DM at diagnosis of CP. Conclusions: Patients with CP have a high risk of developing PDAC, although risk is low in absolute terms. Our data suggest the possibility of defining subgroups of patients with a particularly elevated risk of PDAC. Such a possibility would open a path to personalised decision making on initiation of PDAC surveillance of patients with no previous episode of AP, (i) with low BMI and PEI, or (ii) elevated BMI and DM.',\n",

We demonstrated that miR-519c was down-regulated in pancreatic cancer and transfection of miR-519c in GEM-resistant pancreatic cancer cells inhibited HIF-1alpha level under hypoxia. We synthesized redox-sensitive mPEG-co-P(Asp)-g-DC-g-S-S-GEM polymer, with GEM payload of 14% (w/w) and 90% GEM release upon incubation with l-glutathione. We synthesized mPEG-co-P(Asp)-g-TEPA-g-DC for complex formation with miRNA. Chemical modification of miR-519c with 2'-O-methyl phosphorothioate (OMe-PS) at 3' end enhanced its stability and activity without being immunogenic. Epidermal growth factor receptor targeting peptide GE11 decoration increased tumor accumulation of micelles after systemic administration and significantly inhibited orthotopic desmoplastic pancreatic cancer growth in NSG mice by down-regulating HIF-1alpha and genes responsible for glucose uptake and cancer cell metabolism. Our multifunctional nanomedicine of GEM and OMe-PS-miR-519c offers a novel therapeutic strategy to treat desmoplasia and hypoxia-induced chemoresistance in pancreatic cancer.\",\n",

Although the treatment options are slightly improving, PDAC is the second leading cause of cancer related death in 2020 in the US. In addition to a pronounced desmoplastic stroma reaction, pancreatic cancer is characterized by one of the lowest levels of oxygen availability within the tumor mass and these hypoxic conditions are known to contribute to tumor development and progression. In this context, the major hypoxia associated transcription factor family, HIF, regulates hundreds of genes involved in angiogenesis, metabolism, migration, invasion, immune escape and therapy resistance. Current research implications show, that hypoxia also modulates diverse areas of epigenetic mechanisms like non-coding RNAs, histone modifications or DNA methylation, which cooperate with the hypoxia-induced transcription factors as well as directly regulate the hypoxic response pathways. In this review, we will focus on hypoxia-mediated epigenetic alterations and their impact on pancreatic cancer.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: The majority of patients with pancreatic cancer develops cachexia. The mechanisms underlying cancer cachexia development and progression remain elusive, although tumour-derived factors are considered to play a major role. Pancreatic tumour organoids are in vitro three-dimensional organ-like structures that retain many pathophysiological characteristics of the in vivo tumour. We aimed to establish a pancreatic tumour organoid biobank from well-phenotyped cachectic and non-cachectic patients to enable identification of tumour-derived factors driving cancer cachexia. METHODS: Organoids were generated from tumour tissue of eight pancreatic cancer patients. A comprehensive pre-operative patient assessment of cachexia-related parameters including nutritional status, physical performance, body composition, and inflammation was performed. Tumour-related and cachexia-related characteristics of the organoids were analysed using histological stainings, targeted sequencing, and real-time-quantitative PCR. Cachexia-related factors present in the circulation of the patients and in the tumour organoid secretome were analysed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: The established human pancreatic tumour organoids presented typical features of malignancy corresponding to the primary tumour (i.e. nuclear enlargement, multiple nucleoli, mitosis, apoptosis, and mutated KRAS and/or TP53). These tumour organoids also expressed variable levels of many known cachexia-related genes including interleukin-6 (IL-6), TNF-alpha, IL-8, IL-1alpha, IL-1beta, Mcp-1, GDF15, and LIF. mRNA expression of IL-1alpha and IL-1beta was significantly reduced in organoids from cachectic vs. non-cachectic patients (IL-1alpha: -3.8-fold, P = 0.009, and IL-1beta: -4.7-fold, P = 0.004). LIF, IL-8, and GDF15 mRNA expression levels were significantly higher in organoids from cachectic vs. non-cachectic patients (LIF: 1.6-fold, P = 0.003; IL-8: 1.4-fold, P = 0.01; GDF15: 2.3-fold, P < 0.001). In line with the GDF15 and IL-8 mRNA expression levels, tumour organoids from cachectic patients secreted more GDF15 and IL-8 compared with organoids from non-cachectic patients (5.4 vs. 1.5 ng/mL, P = 0.01, and 7.4 vs. 1.3 ng/mL, P = 0.07, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: This novel human pancreatic tumour organoid biobank provides a valuable tool to increase our understanding of the mechanisms driving cancer cachexia. Our preliminary characterization of the secretome of these organoids supports their application in functional studies including conditioned medium approaches and in vivo transplantation models.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Although epidemiological studies have shown a relationship between periodontal disease and pancreatic cancer, the molecular mechanisms involved remain unclear. In this study, the effects of systemic administration of Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide (PG-LPS) on gene expression were comprehensively explored in mouse pancreas that did not demonstrate any signs of inflammation. PG-LPS was prepared in physiological saline and intraperitoneally administered to male mice at a concentration of 5 mg/kg every 3 days for 1 month. After extracting total RNA from the excised mice pancreas, a comprehensive DNA microarray analysis of gene expression was performed. Tissue specimens were also subjected to hematoxylin-eosin staining and immunohistochemistry using anti-regenerating islet-derived 3A and G (Reg3A/G) antibody. ImageJ software was used to quantify the area of Reg3A/G positive cells in pancreatic islets by binarizing image date followed by area extraction. The results were compared using Mann-Whitney U test. Data are presented as mean +/- standard deviation (SD) with p < 0.05 considered as significant. Reg3G, a gene related to pancreatic cancer, was one of the 10 genes with the highest levels of expression in the pancreas stimulated with PG-LPS. The comprehensive analysis revealed a 73-fold increase in Reg3G expression level in the PG-LPS group when compared with the control group; in addition, the expression level of Reg3A was increased by 11-fold in the PG-LPS group. Image analysis showed that the ratio of Reg3A/G positive cells was higher in the PG-LPS group than the control. Immunostaining showed the presence of Reg3A/G-positive cells in the alpha-cell equivalent areas around the islets of Langerhans in the PG-LPS group. These results support the notion that periodontal disease may be a risk factor for pancreatic cancer.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Weight loss and body composition changes are common in patients with pancreatic cancer. Computed tomography (CT) images are helpful to investigate body composition and its changes and to discriminate the different kinds of body tissues. Patients with pancreatic cancer routinely undergo CT scans. OBJECTIVE: To verify the association of muscle mass and visceral fat measured by CT with toxicity and survival of patients with pancreatic cancer. METHODS: We evaluated the imaging of the abdomen of all consecutive adult patients with pancreatic cancer treated between October 2007 and September 2015 in our service, to assess skeletal muscle mass and fat, intramuscular fat and visceral fat. We graded treatment toxicity symptoms according to the Common Toxicity Criteria of the United States National Cancer Institute (version 2.0). RESULTS: The study involved 17 patients, with a mean age of 63 (+/-10) years (range: 51-73 years). Eleven (65%) were male. The mean initial body mass index (BMI) was 26 kg/m2 (+/-3) and 23 kg/m2 (+/-3) after treatment. The mean weight loss was 10.0 kg (+/-6.8; 13%). Sarcopenia was present in 47% of patients, and it was not associated with significant differences in muscle mass, visceral fat, toxicity or survival. The mean skeletal muscle attenuation was 36 Hounsfield units, not associated with survival or treatment toxicity. Mean muscle mass was not associated with toxicity either. However, there was a significant inverse association between toxicity and visceral fat. CONCLUSION: Muscle mass had no impact on the survival or on treatment toxicity among the patients with pancreatic cancer. However, the visceral fat exerted a protective effect against the treatment toxicity. We stress the importance of further studies on visceral fat associated with prognosis and toxicity in cancer patients.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Despite major advances in cancer treatment, pancreatic cancer is still incurable and the treatment outcomes are limited. The aggressive and therapy-resistant nature of pancreatic cancer warrants the need for novel treatment options for pancreatic cancer management. Drug repurposing is emerging as an effectual strategy in the treatment of various diseases, including cancer. In the present study, we evaluated the anticancer effects of pimavanserin tartrate (PVT), an antipsychotic drug used for the treatment of Parkinson disease psychosis. PVT significantly suppressed the proliferation and induced apoptosis in various pancreatic cancer cells and gemcitabine-resistant cells with minimal effects on normal pancreatic epithelial cells and lung fibroblasts. Growth-suppressive and apoptotic effects of PVT were mediated by the inhibition of the Akt/Gli1 signaling axis. The oral administration of PVT suppressed subcutaneous and orthotopic pancreatic tumor xenografts by 51%-77%. The chronic administration of PVT did not demonstrate any general signs of toxicity or change in behavioral activity of mice. Our results indicate that pancreatic tumor growth suppression by PVT was orchestrated by the inhibition of Akt/Gli1 signaling. Since PVT is already available in the clinic with an established safety profile, our results will accelerate its clinical development for the treatment of patients with pancreatic cancer.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Cachexia is a major cause of morbidity in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients. Our purpose was to understand the impact of PDAC-induced cachexia on brain metabolism in PDAC xenograft studies, to gain new insights into the causes of cachexia-induced morbidity. Changes in mouse and human plasma metabolites were characterized to identify underlying causes of brain metabolic changes. METHODS: We quantified metabolites, detected with high-resolution (1) H magnetic resonance spectroscopy, in the brain and plasma of normal mice (n = 10) and mice bearing cachexia (n = 10) or non-cachexia (n = 9) inducing PDAC xenografts as well as in human plasma obtained from normal individuals (n = 24) and from individuals with benign pancreatic disease (n = 20) and PDAC (n = 20). Statistical significance was defined as a P value </=0.05. RESULTS: The brain metabolic signature of cachexia-inducing PDAC was characterized by a significant depletion of choline of -27% and -21% as well as increases of glutamine of 13% and 9% and formate of 21% and 14%, relative to normal controls and non-cachectic tumour-bearing mice, respectively. Good to moderate correlations with percent weight change were found for choline (r = 0.70), glutamine (r = -0.58), and formate (r = -0.43). Significant choline depletion of -38% and -30%, relative to normal controls and non-cachectic tumour-bearing mice, respectively, detected in the plasma of cachectic mice likely contributed to decreased brain choline in cachectic mice. Similarly, relative to normal controls and patients with benign disease, choline levels in human plasma samples of PDAC patients were significantly lower by -12% and -20% respectively. A comparison of plasma metabolites from PDAC patients with and without weight loss identified significant changes in glutamine metabolism. CONCLUSIONS: Disturbances in metabolites of the choline/cholinergic and glutamine/glutamate/glutamatergic neurotransmitter pathways may contribute to morbidity. Metabolic normalization may provide strategies to reduce morbidity. The human plasma metabolite changes observed may lead to the development of companion diagnostic markers to detect PDAC and PDAC-induced cachexia.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Many tumors of endodermal origin are composed of highly secretory cancer cells that must adapt endoplasmic reticulum (ER) activity to enable proper folding of secreted proteins and prevent ER stress. We found that pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDACs) overexpress the myelin regulatory factor (MYRF), an ER membrane-associated transcription factor (TF) released by self-cleavage. MYRF was expressed in the well-differentiated secretory cancer cells, but not in the poorly differentiated quasi-mesenchymal cells that coexist in the same tumor. MYRF expression was controlled by the epithelial identity TF HNF1B, and it acted to fine-tune the expression of genes encoding highly glycosylated, cysteine-rich secretory proteins, thus preventing ER overload. MYRF-deficient PDAC cells showed signs of ER stress, impaired proliferation, and an inability to form spheroids in vitro, while in vivo they generated highly secretory but poorly proliferating and hypocellular tumors. These data indicate a role of MYRF in the control of ER homeostasis in highly secretory PDAC cells.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and cancer-associated cachexia (CAC) are multifactorial and characterized by dysregulated inflammatory networks. Whether the proinflammatory cytokine IL-20 is involved in the complex networks of PDAC and CAC remains unclear. Here, we report that elevated IL-20 levels in tumor tissue correlate with poor overall survival in 72 patients with PDAC. In vivo, we establish a transgenic mouse model (KPC) and an orthotopic PDAC model and examine the therapeutic efficacy of an anti-IL-20 monoclonal antibody (7E). Targeting IL-20 not only prolongs survival and attenuates PD-L1 expression in both murine models but also inhibits tumor growth and mitigates M2-like polarization in the orthotopic PDAC model. Combination treatment with 7E and an anti-PD-1 antibody shows better efficacy in inhibiting tumor growth than either treatment alone in the orthotopic PDAC model. Finally, 7E mitigates cachexic symptoms in CAC models. Together, we conclude IL-20 is a critical mediator in PDAC progression.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) construction poses numerous challenges that limit clinical progress. In particular, common bioconjugation methods afford minimal control over the site of drug coupling to antibodies. Here, such difficulties are overcome through re-bridging of the inter-chain disulfides of cetuximab (CTX) with auristatin-bearing pyridazinediones, to yield a highly refined anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) ADC. METHODS: In vitro and in vivo assessment of ADC activity was performed in KRAS mutant pancreatic cancer (PaCa) models with known resistance to CTX therapy. Computational modelling was employed for quantitative prediction of tumour response to various ADC dosing regimens. RESULTS: Site-selective coupling of an auristatin to CTX yielded an ADC with an average drug:antibody ratio (DAR) of 3.9, which elicited concentration- and EGFR-dependent cytotoxicity at sub-nanomolar potency in vitro. In human xenografts, the ADC inhibited tumour growth and prolonged survival, with no overt signs of toxicity. Key insights into factors governing ADC efficacy were obtained through a robust mathematical framework, including target-mediated dispositional effects relating to antigen density on tumour cells. CONCLUSIONS: Together, our findings offer renewed hope for CTX in PaCa therapy, demonstrating that it may be reformatted as a next-generation ADC and combined with a predictive modelling tool to guide successful translation.',\n",

The patient was, therefore, followed-up for 3 months, during which time the cyst increased in size and developed a cyst-in-cyst structure. She was diagnosed with mucinous cyst neoplasm and underwent distal pancreatectomy. Histologically, the patient was diagnosed as low-grade mucinous cystic adenoma. Soft tissue shadows around the splenic artery were considered to indicate fibrosis and infiltration of inflammatory cells.

       "  'AB': 'OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate depression in pancreatic cancer (PC) patients before and after a cancer diagnosis using a US-based healthcare database. We also sought to study the impact of treatment of depression in PC patients on all-cause mortality. METHODS: Pancreatic cancer patients with comorbid depression in Explorys (1999-2019) were compared with controls using odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals. Rates of depression diagnosed within 6 months, 1 year, and 3 years before and after a PC diagnosis were recorded. Patients who developed depression after a PC diagnosis were further categorized into those treated for depression using mental health professionals (MHPs), pharmacologic treatment, or both (2015-2019). RESULTS: Of the 62,450 PC patients, 10,220 (16.4%) were diagnosed with depression before PC and 8130 (13%) were diagnosed with depression after PC. Patients diagnosed with depression after PC had a significantly higher all-cause mortality than patients with PC alone (P < 0.0001). Involvement of MHP significantly improved all-cause mortality (P = 0.0041). CONCLUSIONS: Most post-PC depression is diagnosed in the first 6 months after a PC diagnosis. Although depression significantly increases PC mortality, integrating MHP in the care of PC patients with depression improves outcomes.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Sarcopenia is a prognostic factor in various cancers. However, the impact of sarcopenia in patients with recurrent pancreatic cancer remains unclear. This study evaluated the prognostic significance of sarcopenia in patients with recurrent pancreatic cancer. METHODS: Seventy-four patients who developed postoperative recurrence of pancreatic cancer after undergoing pancreatectomies were enrolled. Sarcopenia in these patients was defined according to the psoas muscle index (PMI) measured via computed tomography at the third vertebra. RESULTS: The mean PMIs at the time of recurrence were 4.47 +/- 1.27 cm(2)/m(2) for men and 3.26 +/- 0.70 cm(2)/m(2) for women. Of the 74 patients, 65 (87.8%) were diagnosed with sarcopenia with low PMI. The 2-year post-recurrence survival curve in the sarcopenia group was significantly worse than that in the non-sarcopenia group (P = 0.034). Multivariate analysis revealed that sarcopenia at the time of recurrence was an independent prognostic factor (P = 0.043) along with a high neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (P = 0.004), early recurrence (P = 0.001), and chemotherapy after recurrence (P = 0.005) in patients with recurrent pancreatic cancer. Furthermore, the area under the curve (AUC) of the combination of sarcopenia and time to recurrence for predicting 2-year survival was 0.763, which was much higher than that of sarcopenia alone (AUC = 0.622). CONCLUSIONS: Sarcopenia is a useful prognostic factor in patients with recurrent pancreatic cancer. The combination of sarcopenia and time of recurrence may more accurately predict post-recurrence survival than can sarcopenia alone.',\n",

       "  'AB': \"IMPORTANCE: Pancreatic cancer is the third-leading cause of cancer death in the United States; however, few high-risk groups have been identified to facilitate early diagnosis strategies. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association of diabetes duration and recent weight change with subsequent risk of pancreatic cancer in the general population. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study obtained data from female participants in the Nurses' Health Study and male participants in the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study, with repeated exposure assessments over 30 years. Incident cases of pancreatic cancer were identified from self-report or during follow-up of participant deaths. Deaths were ascertained through reports from the next of kin, the US Postal Service, or the National Death Index. Data collection was conducted from October 1, 2018, to December 31, 2018. Data analysis was performed from January 1, 2019, to June 30, 2019. EXPOSURES: Duration of physician-diagnosed diabetes and recent weight change. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES: Hazard ratios (HRs) for subsequent development of pancreatic cancer. RESULTS: Of the 112\\u202f818 women (with a mean [SD] age of 59.4 [11.7] years) and 46\\u202f207 men (with a mean [SD] age of 64.7 [10.8] years) included in the analysis, 1116 incident cases of pancreatic cancers were identified. Compared with participants with no diabetes, those with recent-onset diabetes had an age-adjusted HR for pancreatic cancer of 2.97 (95% CI, 2.31-3.82) and those with long-standing diabetes had an age-adjusted HR of 2.16 (95% CI, 1.78-2.60). Compared with those with no weight loss, participants who reported a 1- to 4-lb weight loss had an age-adjusted HR for pancreatic cancer of 1.25 (95% CI, 1.03-1.52), those with a 5- to 8-lb weight loss had an age-adjusted HR of 1.33 (95% CI, 1.06-1.66), and those with more than an 8-lb weight loss had an age-adjusted HR of 1.92 (95% CI, 1.58-2.32). Participants with recent-onset diabetes accompanied by weight loss of 1 to 8 lb (91 incident cases per 100\\u202f000 person-years [95% CI, 55-151]; HR, 3.61 [95% CI, 2.14-6.10]) or more than 8 lb (164 incident cases per 100\\u202f000 person-years [95% CI, 114-238]; HR, 6.75 [95% CI, 4.55-10.00]) had a substantially increased risk for pancreatic cancer compared with those with neither exposure (16 incident cases per 100\\u202f000 person-years; 95% CI, 14-17). Incidence rates were even higher among participants with recent-onset diabetes and weight loss with a body mass index of less than 25 before weight loss (400 incident cases per 100\\u202f000 person-years) or whose weight loss was not intentional judging from increased physical activity or healthier dietary choices (334 incident cases per 100\\u202f000 person-years). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study demonstrates that recent-onset diabetes accompanied by weight loss is associated with a substantially increased risk for developing pancreatic cancer. Older age, previous healthy weight, and no intentional weight loss further elevate this risk.\",\n",

       "  'AB': 'The incidence of pancreatic cancer (PCa) is increasing worldwide and has become one of the leading causes of cancer-related death. Screening for high risk populations is fundamental to overcome this intractable malignancy. Diabetes mellitus (DM) is classically known as a risk factor for PCa. Recently the reverse causality is in the spotlight, that is to say, DM is considered to be a manifestation of PCa. Numbers of epidemiological studies clarified that new-onset DM (</=2-year duration) was predominant in PCa patients and the relative risk for PCa inversely correlated with duration of DM. Among patients with new-onset DM, elder onset, weight loss, and rapid exacerbation of glycemic control were reported to be promising risk factors and signs, and the model was developed by combining these factors. Several pilot studies disclosed the possible utility of biomarkers to discriminate PCa-associated DM from type 2 DM. However, there is no reliable biomarkers to be used in the practice. We previously reported the application of a multivariate index for PCa based on the profile of plasma free amino acids (PFAAs) among diabetic patients. We are further investigating on the PFAA profile of PCa-associated DM, and it can be useful for developing the novel biomarker in the near future.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Diabetes mellitus (DM) and pancreatic cancer (PC) in the elderly are widely considered to be interrelated. New-onset diabetes (NOD) patients are considered a high-risk group for the development of PC within three years of diagnosis. We reviewed the literature to determine the pathophysiological association between DM and PC, which can help in the development of screening tests for early PC diagnosis in the elderly with NOD. We also studied the potential associations between them after pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) or pancreatic resection. We collected studies published in the last five years in PubMed that are relevant to DM and PC in the elderly. We mainly focused on the pathophysiology and intracellular mechanisms involved between NOD and PC. We illustrated the clinical signs and immunological and metabolic biomarkers that can be used to diagnose early PC in the elderly with NOD. In the 34 studies we reviewed, five showed that long-term diabetes mellitus (LTDM) increases the risk of PC. Six studies showed that NOD in the elderly is an early sign of PC. Fourteen studies proposed that clinical signs and biomarker levels should be used to determine the high-risk risk group for PC among NOD patients. Six studies reported that NOD is associated with the worst outcomes postoperatively, and three studies showed that patients developed DM after pancreatic resection. LTDM is considered an independent risk factor for PC development in the elderly. NOD is a consequence and maybe the only early presenting sign of PC. Screening protocols and tests should be used in clinical practice to determine the proportion of NOD patients who should undergo further testing for early diagnosis of PC. DM and PC are also co-related postoperatively and patients should be monitored for impaired glucose levels, overall survival, and mortality.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Cancer cachexia patients experience significant muscle wasting, which impairs the quality of life and treatment efficacy for patients. Skeletal muscle protein turnover is imparted by increased expression of ubiquitin-proteasome pathway components. Mitogen-activated protein kinases p38 and ERK have been shown to augment E3 ubiquitin ligase expression. Utilizing reverse-phase protein arrays, we identified pancreatic cancer cell-conditioned media-induced activation of JNK signaling in myotubes differentiated from C2C12 myoblasts. Inhibition of JNK signaling with SP600125 reduced cancer cell-conditioned media-induced myotube atrophy, myosin heavy chain protein turnover, and mRNA expression of cachexia-specific ubiquitin ligases Trim63 and Fbxo32. Furthermore, utilizing an orthotopic pancreatic cancer cachexia mouse model, we demonstrated that treatment of tumor-bearing mice with SP600125 improved longitudinal measurements of forelimb grip strength. Post-necropsy measurements demonstrated that SP600125 treatment rescued body weight, carcass weight, and gastrocnemius muscle weight loss without impacting tumor growth. JNK inhibitor treatment also rescued myofiber degeneration and reduced the muscle expression of Trim63 and Fbxo32. These data demonstrate that JNK signaling contributes to muscle wasting in cancer cachexia, and its inhibition has the potential to be utilized as an anti-cachectic therapy.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Pancreatic cancer is a rare but fatal form of cancer, the fourth highest in absolute mortality. Known risk factors include obesity, diet, and type 2 diabetes; however, the low incidence rate and interconnection of these factors confound the isolation of individual effects. Here, we use epidemiological analysis of prospective human cohorts and parallel tracking of pancreatic cancer in mice to dissect the effects of obesity, diet, and diabetes on pancreatic cancer. Through longitudinal monitoring and multi-omics analysis in mice, we found distinct effects of protein, sugar, and fat dietary components, with dietary sugars increasing Mad2l1 expression and tumor proliferation. Using epidemiological approaches in humans, we find that dietary sugars give a MAD2L1 genotype-dependent increased susceptibility to pancreatic cancer. The translation of these results to a clinical setting could aid in the identification of the at-risk population for screening and potentially harness dietary modification as a therapeutic measure.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND Irinotecan, a topoisomerase I inhibitor, is a cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agent used to treat multiple malignancies, including those of colorectal, pancreatic, cervical, esophageal, gastric, and lung origin. Dysarthria, a state of difficult or unclear articulation of speech, has been reported as a rare side effect of irinotecan through multiple case reports and case series, but with limited published data aimed at understanding the underlying mechanism and effective management strategies. CASE REPORT We describe herein 3 cases of patients with pancreatic malignancy who experienced dysarthria while being treated with a chemotherapy regimen containing irinotecan at an ambulatory outpatient satellite chemotherapy site. All patients described received first-line FOLFIRINOX for pancreatic cancer and experienced dysarthria during their first infusion of irinotecan. In all cases, dysarthria was observed as a transient adverse drug reaction within the first 10 to 70 min of irinotecan infusion, which resolved rapidly upon pausing infusion without any long-term sequalae. All patients remained conscious and alert; physical and neurological examinations at dysarthria onset revealed no abnormalities. Some patients experienced distal extremity paresthesia, a known manifestation of oxaliplatin-induced acute neurotoxicity, and diaphoresis and nausea. Increased infusion time effectively prevented dysarthria during subsequent infusions. CONCLUSIONS Oncologists, pharmacists, nurses, and other care team members should be aware that irinotecan-associated dysarthria is a rare, mild, and self-limiting phenomenon to avoid inadvertently altering or withholding therapy. We suggest extending irinotecan infusion time, as opposed to dose reduction or treatment discontinuation, as a practical clinical management strategy for patients who develop recurrent dysarthria secondary to irinotecan infusion.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Pancreatic and periampullary cancers are rare but have high mortality rates. The only hope for cure is surgical removal of the tumor. Following pancreatic surgery, the patients have a great deal of responsibility for managing their symptoms. Patients report a lack of sufficient knowledge of self-care and unmet supportive care needs. This necessitates a health care system responsive to these needs and health care professionals who pay close attention to symptoms. Person-centered care is widely encouraged and means a shift from a model in which the patient is the passive object of care to a model involving the patient as an active participant in their own care. To address the challenges in care following pancreatic cancer surgery, an interactive app (Interaktor) was developed in which patients regularly report symptoms and receive support for self-care. The app has been shown to reduce patients\\' symptom burden and to increase their self-care activity levels following pancreaticoduodenectomy due to cancer. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to describe how patients used the Interaktor app following pancreaticoduodenectomy due to cancer and their experience with doing so. METHODS: A total of 115 patients were invited to use Interaktor for 6 months following pancreaticoduodenectomy. Of those, 35 declined, 8 dropped out, and 46 did not meet the inclusion criteria after surgery, leaving 26 patients for inclusion in the analysis. The patients were instructed to report symptoms daily through the app for up to 6 months following surgery. In case of alerting symptoms, they were contacted by their nurse. Data on reported symptoms, alerts, and viewed self-care advice were logged and analyzed with descriptive statistics. Also, the patients were interviewed about their experiences, and the data were analyzed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: The patients\\' median adherence to symptom reporting was 82%. Fatigue and pain were the most reported symptoms. Alerting symptoms were reported by 24 patients, and the most common alert was fever. There were variations in how many times the patients viewed the self-care advice (range 3-181 times). The most commonly viewed advice concerned pancreatic enzyme supplements. Through the interviews, the overarching theme was \"Being seen as a person,\" with the following 3 sub-themes: \"Getting your voice heard,\" \"Having access to an extended arm of health care,\" and \"Learning about own health.\" CONCLUSIONS: Interaktor proved to be well accepted. It made patients feel reassured at home and offered support for self-care. The app facilitated person-centered care by its multiple features targeting individual supportive care needs and enabled participation in their own care. This supports our recent studies showing that patients using the app had less symptom burden and higher self-care activity levels than patients receiving only standard care.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Cachexia is a major characteristic of multiple non-malignant diseases, advanced and metastatic cancers and it is highly prevalent in pancreatic cancer, affecting almost 70-80% of the patients. Cancer cachexia is a multifactorial condition accompanied by compromised appetite and changes in body composition, i.e., loss of fat. It is associated with lower effectiveness of treatment, compromised quality of life, and higher mortality. Understanding the complex pathways underlying the pathophysiology of cancer cachexia, new therapeutic targets will be unraveled. The interplay between tumor and host factors, such as cytokines, holds a central role in cachexia pathophysiology. Cytokines are possibly responsible for anorexia, hypermetabolism, muscle proteolysis, and apoptosis. In particular, cachexia in pancreatic cancer might be the result of the surgical removal of pancreas parts. In recent years, many studies have been carried out to identify an effective treatment algorithm for cachexia. Choosing the most appropriate treatment, the clinical effect and the risk of adverse effects should be taken under consideration. The purpose of this review is to highlight the pathophysiological mechanisms as well as the current ways of cachexia treatment in the pharmaceutical and the nutrition field.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'The incidence of obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2DM) in the Western world has increased dramatically during the recent decades. According to the American Cancer Society, pancreatic cancer (PC) is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States. The relationship among obesity, T2DM and PC is complex. Due to increase in obesity, diabetes, alcohol consumption and sedentary lifestyle, the mortality due to PC is expected to rise significantly by year 2040. The underlying mechanisms by which diabetes and obesity contribute to pancreatic tumorigenesis are not well understood. Furthermore, metabolism and microenvironment within the pancreas can also modulate pancreatic carcinogenesis. The risk of PC on a population level may be reduced by modifiable lifestyle risk factors. In this review, the interactions of diabetes and obesity to PC development were summarized, and novel strategies for the prevention and treatment of diabetes and PC were discussed.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most abundant reversible methylation modification of eukaryotic mRNA, and it plays vital roles in tumourigenesis. This study aimed to explore the role of the m6A demethylase ALKBH5 in pancreatic cancer (PC). METHODS: The expression of ALKBH5 and its clinicopathological impact were evaluated in PC cohorts. The effects of ALKBH5 on the biological characteristics of PC cells were investigated on the basis of gain-of-function and loss-of-function analyses. Subcutaneous and orthotopic models further uncovered the role of ALKBH5 in tumour growth. mRNA and m6A sequencing and assays of m6A methylated RNA immunoprecipitation-qPCR (MeRIP-qPCR) were performed to identify the targeted effect of ALKBH5 on PER1. P53-binding sites in the ALKBH5 promoter were investigated by ChIP and luciferase assays to reveal the interplay between ALKBH5 and PER1-activated ATM-CHK2-P53/CDC25C signalling. RESULTS: ALKBH5 loss characterized the occurrence and poor clinicopathological manifestations in patients with PC. Overexpression of ALKBH5 reduced tumoural proliferative, migrative, invasive activities in vitro and ameliorated tumour growth in vivo, whereas ALKBH5 knockdown facilitated PC progression. Mechanistically, ALKBH5 posttranscriptionally activated PER1 by m6A demethylation in an m6A-YTHDF2-dependent manner. PER1 upregulation led to the reactivation of ATM-CHK2-P53/CDC25C signalling, which inhibited cell growth. P53-induced activation of ALKBH5 transcription acted as a feedback loop regulating the m6A modifications in PC. CONCLUSION: ALKBH5 serves as a PC suppressor by regulating the posttranscriptional activation of PER1 through m6A abolishment, which may highlight a demethylation-based approach for PC diagnosis and therapy.',\n",

Inflammation in the brain is a driver of these symptoms, yet cellular sources of neuroinflammation during malignancy are unknown. In a mouse model of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), we observed early and robust myeloid cell infiltration into the brain. Infiltrating immune cells were predominately neutrophils, which accumulated at a unique central nervous system entry portal called the velum interpositum, where they expressed CCR2. Pharmacologic CCR2 blockade and genetic deletion of Ccr2 both resulted in significantly decreased brain-infiltrating myeloid cells as well as attenuated cachexia during PDAC. Lastly, intracerebroventricular blockade of the purinergic receptor P2RX7 during PDAC abolished immune cell recruitment to the brain and attenuated anorexia. Our data demonstrate a novel function for the CCR2/CCL2 axis in recruiting neutrophils to the brain, which drives anorexia and muscle catabolism.',\n",

Therefore, there is an unmet clinical need to better understand the predisposing factors for pancreatic cancer in hopes of providing early screening to high-risk patients. While select risk factors such as age, race, and family history, or predisposing syndromes are unavoidable, there are several new and established risk factors that allow for intervention, namely by counseling patients to make the appropriate lifestyle modifications. Here, we discuss the best-studied risk factors for PDAC such as tobacco use and chronic pancreatitis, as well as newly emerging risk factors including select nutritional deficits, bacterial infections, and psychosocial factors. As several of these risk factors appear to be additive or synergistic, by understanding their relationships and offering coordinated, multidisciplinary care to high-risk patients, it may be possible to reduce pancreatic cancer incidence and improve clinical outcomes through early detection.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a malignancy with little/no warning signs before the disease reaches its ultimate stages. Currently early detection of PC is very difficult because most patients have non-specific symptoms leading to postponing the correct diagnosis. In this study, using multiple bioinformatics tools, we integrated various serum expression profiles of miRNAs to find the most significant miRNA signatures helpful in diagnosis of PC and constructed novel miRNA diagnosis models for PC. Altogether, 27 differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs) showed area under curve (AUC) score >80%. The most promising miRNAs, miR-1469 and miR-4530, were individually able to distinguish two groups with the highest specificity and sensitivity. By using multivariate cox regression analyses, 5 diagnostic models consisting of different combinations of miRNAs, based on their significant expression algorithms and functional properties were introduced. The correlation model consisting of miR-125a-3p, miR-5100 and miR-642b-3p was the most promising model in the diagnosis of PC patients from healthy controls with an AUC of 0.95, Sensitivity 0.98 and Specificity 0.97. Validation analysis was conducted for considered miRNAs on a final cohort consist of the microarray data from two other datasets (GSE112264 & GSE124158) . These results provide some potential biomarkers for PC diagnosis after testing in large case-control and cohort studies.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Incidence of cachexia is highly prevalent in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC); advanced disease stage directly correlates with decreased muscle and fat mass in PDAC patients. The pancreatic tumor microenvironment is central to the release of systemic factors that govern lipolysis, proteolysis, and muscle and fat degeneration leading to the cachectic phenotype in cancer patients. The current study explores the role of macrophages, a key immunosuppressive player in the pancreatic tumor microenvironment, in regulating cancer cachexia. We observed a negative correlation between CD163-positive macrophage infiltration and muscle-fiber cross sectional area in human PDAC patients. To investigate the role of macrophages in myodegeneration, we utilized conditioned media transplant assays and orthotopic models of PDAC-induced cachexia in immune-competent mice with and without macrophage depletion. We observed that macrophage-derived conditioned medium, in combination with tumor cell-conditioned medium, promoted muscle atrophy through STAT3 signaling. Furthermore, macrophage depletion attenuated systemic inflammation and muscle wasting in pancreatic tumor-bearing mice. Targeting macrophage-mediated STAT3 activation or macrophage-derived interleukin-1 alpha or interleukin-6 diminished myofiber atrophy. Taken together, the current study identified the critical association between macrophages and cachexia phenotype in pancreatic cancer.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND & AIMS: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is frequently accompanied by excruciating pain, which has been associated with attraction of cancer cells and their invasion of intrapancreatic sensory nerves. Neutralization of the chemokine CCL2 reduced cancer-associated pain in a clinical trial, but there have been no systematic analyses of the highly diverse chemokine families and their receptors in PDAC. METHODS: We performed an open, unbiased RNA-interference screen of mammalian chemokines in co-cultures of mouse PDAC cells (K8484) and mouse peripheral sensory neurons, and confirmed findings in studies of DT8082 PDAC cells. We studied the effects of chemokines on migration of PDAC cell lines. Orthotopic tumors were grown from K8484 cells in mice, and mice were given injections of neutralizing antibodies against chemokines, antagonists, or control antibodies. We analyzed abdominal mechanical hypersensitivity and collected tumors and analyzed them by histology and immunohistochemistry to assess neural remodeling. We collected PDAC samples and information on pain levels from 74 patients undergoing resection and measured levels of CXCR3 and CCR7 by immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting. RESULTS: Knockdown of 9 chemokines in DRG neurons significantly reduced migration of PDAC cells towards sensory neurons. Sensory neuron-derived CCL21 and CXCL10 promoted migration of PDAC cells via their receptors CCR7 and CXCR3, respectively, which were expressed by cells in orthotopic tumors and PDAC specimens from patients. Neutralization of CCL21 or CXCL10, or their receptors, in mice with orthotopic tumors significantly reduced nociceptive hypersensitivity and nerve fiber hypertrophy and improved behavioral parameters without affecting tumor infiltration by T cells or neutrophils. Increased levels of CXCR3 and CCR7 in human PDAC specimens were associated with increased frequency of cancer-associated pain, determined from patient questionnaires. CONCLUSIONS: In an unbiased screen of chemokines, we identified CCL21 and CXCL10 as proteins that promote migration of pancreatic cancer cells toward sensory neurons. Inhibition of these chemokines or their receptors reduce hypersensitivity in mice with orthotopic tumors, and patients with PDACs with high levels of the chemokine receptors of CXCR3 and CCR7 had increased frequency of cancer-associated pain.',\n",

METHODS: A total of 54 patients with pancreatic cancer were enrolled to evaluate the pain before treatment, detect the expressions of NF-kappaB and COX-2, an inflammatory mediator, in tumor tissues by the immunohistochemical method and analyze their relationships with the pain in these patients. RESULTS: The expressions of NF-kappaB and COX-2 varied obviously among pancreatic cancer patients with different degrees of pain, and as the pain was aggravated, the patients had raised expressions of NF-kappaB and COX-2 in tumor tissues (p<0.05). The degree of pain also differed evidently among the patients at different tumor node metastasis (TNM) stages, and the higher the pathological stage, the higher the degree of pain in patients (p<0.05). The pain score of patients was positively correlated with the expressions of NF-kappaB and COX-2 (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The degree of pain in pancreatic cancer is closely related to the pathological stage and expressions of NF-kappaB and COX-2, and the expressions of NF-kappaB and COX-2 are raised and the pain is aggravated as well in the patients at a higher pathological stage.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Pancreatic cancer is often diagnosed due to the patient seeking medical attention for abdominal pain. It is among the most painful cancers, with pain severity strongly correlating with prognosis. Perineural invasion is a prominent feature of pancreatic cancer and often the first route of metastasis resulting in neuropathic pain. While surgical pain is present, it is generally short-lived; chemo- and radio-therapy associated side effect pain is often longer lasting and more difficult to manage. Treatment-induced mucositis in response to chemotherapy occurs throughout the GI tract resulting in infection-prone ulcers on the lip, buccal mucosa, palate or tongue. Cisplatin treatment is associated with axonal neuropathy in the dorsal root ganglion, although other large sensory fibers can be affected. Opioid-induced hyperalgesia can also emerge in patients. Along with traditional means to address pain, neurolytic celiac plexus block of afferent nociceptive fibers has been reported to be effective in 74% of patients. Moreover, as cancer treatments become more effective and result in improved survival, treatment-related side effects become more prevalent. Here, pancreatic cancer and treatment associated pain are reviewed along with current treatment strategies. Potential future therapeutic strategies to target the pathophysiology underlying pancreatic cancer and pain induction are also presented.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Most pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma patients present with advanced disease. Whether it is possible to increase survival by earlier diagnosis is unclear. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between presenting complaints and risk factors for pancreatic cancer with diagnostic delay, stage and survival. METHODS: This was a single-centre retrospective cohort study. Consecutive patients were interviewed and data on demographics, medical history, risk factors and complaints leading to pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma diagnosis and disease stage were recorded. Diagnostic delay was considered as time between first complaint and diagnosis. Patients received appropriate treatments and their outcome was recorded in a dedicated database. The Chi-square test for comparison of categorical variables and the Mann-Whitney test for continuous variables were employed with Bonferroni corrections. Correlation between continuous variables was evaluated by means of the Spearman correlation coefficient. Survival analysis was performed with the Kaplan-Meier method and a log-rank test. RESULTS: The median diagnostic delay for 477 pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma patients was two months (interquartile range 1-5), being significantly shorter for patients presenting with jaundice compared with those with pain, weight loss, diabetes (p < 0.001). The global rate of metastatic disease at diagnosis was 40%, being only 22% in those presenting with jaundice. The median diagnostic delay, however, was not significantly different among disease stages but was significantly longer in patients with a body mass index>25 kg/m(2). The median survival time was seven months. Factors associated with worse survival at the multivariable analysis were older age (hazard ratio 1.02 per year), metastatic disease (hazard ratio 2.12) and pain as presenting complaint (hazard ratio 1.32), while diagnostic delay was not. CONCLUSION: While some complaints are associated with a shorter diagnostic delay and less advanced disease stage, we could not demonstrate that delay is associated with survival, possibly suggesting that prevention rather than early recognition is important to tackle pancreatic cancer lethality.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Quick diagnosis units (QDU) have become an alternative hospital-based ambulatory medicine strategy to inpatient hospitalization for potentially serious illnesses in Spain. Whether diagnosis of pancreatic cancer is better accomplished by an ambulatory or inpatient approach is unknown. The main objective of this retrospective study was to examine and compare the diagnostic effectiveness of a QDU or inpatient setting in patients with pancreatic cancer.Patients with a diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma who had been referred to a university, tertiary hospital-based QDU or hospitalized between 2005 and 2018 were eligible. Presenting symptoms and signs, risk and prognostic factors, and time to diagnosis were compared. The costs incurred during the diagnostic assessment were analyzed with a microcosting method.A total of 1004 patients (508 QDU patients and 496 inpatients) were eligible. Admitted patients were more likely than QDU patients to have weight loss, asthenia, anorexia, abdominal pain, jaundice, and palpable hepatomegaly. Time to diagnosis of inpatients was similar to that of QDU patients (4.1 [0.8 vs 4.3 [0.6] days; P = .163). Inpatients were more likely than QDU patients to have a tumor on the head of the pancreas, a tumor size >2 cm, a more advanced nodal stage, and a poorer histological differentiation. No differences were observed in the proportion of metastatic and locally advanced disease and surgical resections. Microcosting revealed a cost of &OV0556;347.76 (48.69) per QDU patient and &OV0556;634.36 (80.56) per inpatient (P < .001).Diagnosis of pancreatic cancer is similarly achieved by an inpatient or QDU clinical approach, but the latter seems to be cost-effective. Because the high costs of hospitalization, an ambulatory diagnostic assessment may be preferable in these patients.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Mutations in KRAS result in a constitutively activated MAPK pathway. In KRAS-mutant tumours existing treatment options, e.g. MEK inhibition, have limited efficacy due to resistance through feedback activation of epidermal growth factor receptors (HER). METHODS: In this Phase 1 study, the pan-HER inhibitor dacomitinib was combined with the MEK1/2 inhibitor PD-0325901 in patients with KRAS-mutant colorectal, pancreatic and non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Patients received escalating oral doses of once daily dacomitinib and twice daily PD-0325901 to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D). (Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT02039336). RESULTS: Eight out of 41 evaluable patients (27 colorectal cancer, 11 NSCLC and 3 pancreatic cancer) among 8 dose levels experienced dose-limiting toxicities. The RP2D with continuous dacomitinib dosing was 15 mg of dacomitinib plus 6 mg of PD-0325901 (21 days on/7 days off), but major toxicity, including rash (85%), diarrhoea (88%) and nausea (63%), precluded long-term treatment. Therefore, other intermittent schedules were explored, which only slightly improved toxicity. Tumour regression was seen in eight patients with the longest treatment duration (median 102 days) in NSCLC. CONCLUSIONS: Although preliminary signs of antitumour activity in NSCLC were seen, we do not recommend further exploration of this combination in KRAS-mutant patients due to its negative safety profile.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Pancreatic cancer-associated diabetes mellitus (PCDM) is a paraneoplastic phenomenon characterized by worsening hyperglycaemia and weight loss. Galectin-3 and S100A9, mediators of PCDM, have pro-inflammatory functions and might thereby induce systemic inflammation and cachexia. We aimed to examine whether PCDM directly mediates cachexia. METHODS: Consecutive pancreatic cancer (PC) patients with and without PCDM (n = 88 each) with complete information were included. Cachexia was defined as weight loss >5% within 6 months or weight loss >2% and body mass index <20 kg/m(2) or sarcopenia. Skeletal muscle mass was measured with lumbar skeletal muscle index (SMI) using computed tomography images. Cachexia-related parameters (prevalence of cachexia, weight loss, and SMI) were compared between patients with and without PCDM. Relations between cachexia-related parameters and fasting blood glucose or serum levels of galectin-3 and S100A9 were analysed by Spearman correlation and logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: One hundred two (58.0%) patients had cachexia at diagnosis. No significant differences existed between patients with and without PCDM in prevalence of cachexia (64.8% vs. 51.1%, P = 0.093), percentage of weight loss (median 6.8 vs. 4.0, P = 0.085), and SMI (median 45.8 vs. 45.3 cm(2) /m(2) in men, P = 0.119; 34.9 vs. 36.3 cm(2) /m(2) in women, P = 0.418). In patients with cachexia, the percentage of weight loss and SMI were also similar between patients with and without PCDM. In patients with PCDM, fasting blood glucose was comparable between patients with and without cachexia (P = 0.458) and did not correlate with the percentage of weight loss (P = 0.085) or SMI (P = 0.797 in men and 0.679 in women). Serum S100A9 level correlated with fasting blood glucose (correlation coefficient 0.213, P = 0.047) but not with the percentage of weight loss (P = 0.977) or SMI (P = 0.247 in men and 0.458 in women). Serum galectin-3 level also did not correlate with the percentage of weight loss (P = 0.226) and SMI (P = 0.201 in men and 0.826 in women). Primary tumour size was associated with cachexia (adjusted odds ratio per 1 cm increase 1.28, 95% confidence interval 1.02-1.60, P = 0.034), whereas PCDM, fasting blood glucose, and levels of galectin-3 and S100A9 were not predictors of cachexia. CONCLUSIONS: Neither fasting blood glucose nor levels of galectin-3 and S100A9 were associated with cachexia-related parameters. Mediators of PCDM and hyperglycaemia do not directly mediate PC-induced cachexia.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Chronic obstructive respiratory disorders (ORDs) are linked to increased rates of cancer-related deaths. Little is known about the effects of hypercapnia (elevated CO(2)) on development of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and drug resistance. STUDY DESIGN: Two PDAC cell lines were exposed to normocapnic (5% CO(2)) and hypercapnic (continuous/intermittent 10% CO(2)) conditions, physiologically similar to patients with active ORD. Cells were assessed for proliferation rate, colony formation, and chemo-/radiotherapeutic efficacy. In a retrospective clinical study design, patients with PDAC who had undergone pancreatic resection between 2002 and 2014 were reviewed. Active smokers were excluded to remove possible smoking-related protumorigenic influence. Clinical data, pathologic findings, and survival end points were recorded. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses were performed. RESULTS: Exposure to hypercapnia resulted in increased colony formation and proliferation rates in vitro in both cell lines (MIA-PaCa-2: 111% increase and Panc-1: 114% increase; p < 0.05). Hypercapnia exposure induced a 2.5-fold increase in oxaliplatin resistance (p < 0.05) in both cell lines and increased resistance to ionizing radiation in MIA-PaCa-2 cells (p < 0.05). Five hundred and seventy-eight patients were included (52% were male, median age was 68.7 years [interquartile range 60.6 to 76.8 years]). Cox regression analysis, assessing TNM staging, age, sex, and ORD status, identified ORD as an independent risk factor for both overall survival (hazard ratio 1.64; 95% CI, 1.2 to 2.3; p < 0.05) and disease-free survival (hazard ratio 1.68; 95% CI, 1.06 to 2.67). CONCLUSIONS: PDAC cells exposed to hypercapnic environments, which is common in patients with ORD, showed tumor proliferation, radioresistance, and chemoresistance. Patients with a history of ORD had a worse overall prognosis, suggesting that hypercapnic conditions play a role in the development and progression of PDAC and stressing the need for patient-tailored care.',\n",

This concept is well studied in the context of high fat diet induced obesity (HFDO), yet has not been investigated in the context of cachexia, a devastating metabolic syndrome characterized by anorexia, fatigue, and muscle catabolism. We show that microglia accumulate specifically in the MBH early in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC)-associated cachexia and assume an activated morphology. Furthermore, we observe astrogliosis in the MBH and hippocampus concurrent with cachexia initiation. We next show that circulating immune cells resembling macrophages infiltrate the MBH. PDAC-derived factors induced microglia to express a transcriptional profile in vitro that was distinct from that induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Microglia depletion through CSF1-R antagonism resulted in accelerated cachexia onset and increased anorexia, fatigue, and muscle catabolism during PDAC. This corresponded with increased hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activation. CSF1-R antagonism had little effect on inflammatory response in the circulation, liver, or tumor. These findings demonstrate that microglia are protective against PDAC cachexia and provide mechanistic insight into this function.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'OBJECTIVES: Liposomal irinotecan (nal-IRI) is a topoisomerase inhibitor proven to improve survival in metastatic pancreatic cancer (mPC). This study describes real-world characteristics of patients treated with nal-IRI for mPC. METHODS: Patients 18 years or older diagnosed with stage IV mPC and treated with nal-IRI were selected retrospectively from a deidentified electronic health record database of more than 2 million US cancer patients. Demographics, clinical and dosing characteristics, and treatment outcomes were collected. RESULTS: Of 257 total patients, 145 (57%) received nal-IRI as first- or second-line therapy. Median nal-IRI treatment duration was 51 days, longer when nal-IRI was used as first/second versus as third-line therapy or later (62 vs 44.5 days). Seventy patients (27.2%) experienced dose modification. Median time to treatment discontinuation was 2.3 versus 1.6 months for first-/second- versus third-line therapy or later, respectively. Median overall survival from nal-IRI initiation was 5.6 versus 4.1 months for first-/second- versus third-line therapy or later, respectively. Prior irinotecan treatment, baseline serum albumin less than 40 g/L, and baseline neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio greater than 5 were associated with reduced overall survival. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first large US study of real-world US mPC patients treated with nal-IRI. These results, comparable to the NAPOLI-1 trial, can help inform future studies and the efficacy of nal-IRI in mPC therapy.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Hypoxia, the state of low oxygenation that often arises in solid tumours due to their high metabolism and irregular vasculature, is a major contributor to the resistance of tumours to radiation therapy (RT) and other treatments. Conventional RT extends treatment over several weeks or more, and nominally allows time for oxygen levels to increase (\"reoxygenation\") as cancer cells are killed by RT, mitigating the impact of hypoxia. Recent advances in RT have led to an increase in the use stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT), which delivers high doses in five or fewer fractions. For cancers such as pancreatic adenocarcinoma for which hypoxia varies significantly between patients, SBRT might not be optimal, depending on the extent to which reoxygenation occurs during its short duration. We used fluoro-5-deoxy-alpha-D-arabinofuranosyl)-2-nitroimidazole positron-emission tomography (FAZA-PET) imaging to quantify hypoxia before and after 5-fraction SBRT delivered to patient-derived pancreatic cancer xenografts orthotopically implanted in mice. An imaging technique using only the pre-treatment FAZA-PET scan and repeat dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) scans throughout treatment was able to predict the change in hypoxia. Our results support the further testing of this technique for imaging of reoxygenation in the clinic.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'CONTEXT: Although it is well known that patients with advanced pancreatic cancer (PC) experience significant symptom burden, few strategies for effective symptom intervention are available for them. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the efficacy of minocycline, an anti-inflammatory agent, for symptom reduction in patients with advanced PC. METHODS: We conducted Phase II, randomized, and placebo-controlled trial to obtain preliminary estimates of the effects on symptom reduction with 100 mg of minocycline or placebo given twice a day. Eligible patients had diagnosed advanced PC and were scheduled for standard chemotherapy. Patient-reported symptoms were measured weekly during the eight-week trial using the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI) module in patients with gastrointestinal cancer. The primary outcome measure was the area under the curve values of the five most severe symptoms in the two arms. RESULTS: Of the 44 patients recruited, 31 (71%) were evaluable for the primary efficacy analysis, with 18 received minocycline and 13 placebo. Fatigue, pain, disturbed sleep, lack of appetite, and drowsiness were the most severe symptoms reported by both groups. No significant differences in area under the curve values over time between the study arms were found for the composite MDASI score or single-item scores of the five most severe MDASI items. No treatment-related deaths were reported, and no Grade 3-4 toxicities were observed. CONCLUSION: Minocycline is safe for use in patients receiving treatment for PC. There is no observed symptom reduction with minocycline on the major symptom burden associated with advanced PC compared with placebo. Attrition because of rapid disease progression impacted the study significantly.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is currently the fourth most common cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States. It has a poor prognosis and remains a difficulty to treat malignancy. Over the past several decades, significant efforts have been directed towards developing new approaches to enhance the efficacy of therapeutic regimens for PDAC treatment. In recent years, the measurement of serum carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9) has become one of the most validated and extensively used tumour biomarkers for PDAC. In particular, serum CA 19-9 levels have been explored as a validated tool to predict either the signs of disease progression or the response to treatment. However, despite its clinical relevance, the implications on diagnosis or accurately predicting tumour resectability, and monitoring disease symptoms in PDAC patients remains limited. This current review highlights the recent updates on the applicability of CA 19-9, its exploitation, and challenges in predicting the treatment efficacy and responses in PDAC patients.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'INTRODUCTION: Abdominal pain is common and is associated with high disease burden and health care costs in pediatric acute recurrent and chronic pancreatitis (ARP/CP). Despite the strong central component of pain in ARP/CP and the efficacy of psychological therapies for other centralized pain syndromes, no studies have evaluated psychological pain interventions in children with ARP/CP. The current trial seeks to 1) evaluate the efficacy of a psychological pain intervention for pediatric ARP/CP, and 2) examine baseline patient-specific genetic, clinical, and psychosocial characteristics that may predict or moderate treatment response. METHODS: This single-blinded randomized placebo-controlled multicenter trial aims to enroll 260 youth (ages 10-18) with ARP/CP and their parents from twenty-one INSPPIRE (INternational Study Group of Pediatric Pancreatitis: In search for a cuRE) centers. Participants will be randomly assigned to either a web-based cognitive behavioral pain management intervention (Web-based Management of Adolescent Pain Chronic Pancreatitis; WebMAP; N = 130) or to a web-based pain education program (WebED; N = 130). Assessments will be completed at baseline (T1), immediately after completion of the intervention (T2) and at 6 months post-intervention (T3). The primary study outcome is abdominal pain severity. Secondary outcomes include pain-related disability, pain interference, health-related quality of life, emotional distress, impact of pain, opioid use, and healthcare utilization. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of a psychological pain intervention for children with CP for reduction of abdominal pain and improvement of health-related quality of life. Findings will inform delivery of web-based pain management and potentially identify patient-specific biological and psychosocial factors associated with favorable response to therapy.

       "  'AB': 'OBJECTIVES: In this study, characteristics and analgesic treatment of patients with pancreatic cancer who applied to the algology clinic were evaluated. METHODS: Demographic characteristics, pathologic diagnosis, metastasis, cancer treatment, and analgesic interventions in 60 patients with pancreatic cancer, referred to the algology clinic, were examined. RESULTS: The application time of the patients to the clinic was 3.9+-0.92 months after the diagnosis, and the visual analog scale (VAS) was 6.96+-0.11 at the initial assessment. According to the analgesic step ladder protocol, a nonopiod + weak opioid + strong opioid (transdermal) were applied in 58.33%, a nonopioid + weak opioid + strong opiod (oral) in 5%, and nonopiod + weak opioid in 36.66% of the patients. Adjuvant pain medications were used in 68.33% of the patients (benzodiazepine, 80.48%; antidepressant, 19.51%), while no adjuvant was used in 31.66% of the patients. While the mean survival time for patients with pancreatic cancer changed from 3 to 6 months, it was 8.48+-7.46 months for patients who applied to the pain clinic. CONCLUSION: Abdominal pain in pancreatic cancer is the most common symptom that negatively affects the quality of life. A good analgesia improves the survival, while pain decreases the survival. The results of the present study demonstrated that the survival of the patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer who received effective pain therapy in the algology clinic may be longer.',\n",

Abnormal electroretinograms led to suspicion of cancer-associated retinopathy (CAR), and CT of the abdomen showed an underlying pancreatic malignancy, detected with subclinical liver function tests following diagnosis of CAR. Biopsy showed a T2N0M0 ampullary adenocarcinoma. The patient was managed with Whipple's procedure and adjuvant chemotherapy and has made a good recovery with no progression of her retinopathy. To our knowledge, this is one of the first descriptions of CAR in the context of pancreatic malignancy. It is atypical in its asymmetric presentation and favourable patient outcome. CAR is an important diagnosis to make, as ocular manifestations can be the only indication of an occult malignancy, resulting in a swifter diagnosis and potentially life-saving early intervention.\",\n",

Even serum IgG4 and biopsy sometimes cannot give clear-cut differential accurate diagnostis. Considering the totally different management strategy of the two diseases, accurate diagnostic value is urgently needed to remind the clinicians of the rare diagnosis of untypical AIP among frequent PC-suspected patients. RESULTS: We present 2 laparotomy cases of AIP that had a high similar characteristic to PC and retrospectively extracted the warning signs that may help select untypical AIP in PC-suspected patients. CONCLUSIONS: We find that mild fluctuating jaundice with abdominal pain, young age, tumor marker of TPS, TPA and diverse results between variable radiological tests can help to differentiate AIP mass from PC, through retrospectively analyzing work-up process of AIP in two patients who underwent laparotomy for suspected PC.',\n",

It often occurs in patients with immunodeficiency due to various factors, such as cancer, diabetes mellitus, and organ transplantation. The identification of gram-positive bacilli in septicemia, the presence of gas-forming liver damage and intravascular hemolysis are manifestations of Clostridium perfringens infection. The episode deteriorates rapidly and has a high mortality rate. CASE PRESENTATION: This case involved a 60-year-old man with infection onset 2 weeks after common bile duct stenting for obstructive jaundice caused by unresectable pancreatic cancer. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed gas-containing lesions in the liver. Blood culture showed Clostridium perfringens. Though aggressively rescued, he died within 24 hrs after admission. CONCLUSION: Clostridium perfringens liver infection is rare but leads to a severe prognosis rapidly. High awareness of this condition is key for early diagnosis and effective treatment.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'More than 90% of human pancreatic cancers carry the oncogenic mutant of Ki-RAS and their growth depends on its downstream kinase PAK1, mainly because PAK1 blocks the apoptosis of cancer cells selectively. We developed a highly cell-permeable PAK1-blocker called 15K from an old pain-killer (ketorolac), that is shown here to inhibit the growth of three pancreatic cancer cell lines with IC50 values ranging 41-88 nM in vitro. The anti-cancer effect of 15K was further investigated in an orthotopic xenograft model with gemcitabine (GEM)-resistant human pancreatic cancer cell lines (AsPC-1 and BxPC-3) expressing luciferase in athymic mice. During 4 weeks, 15K blocks total burden (growth) of both AsPC-1 and BxPC-3 tumors (measured as radians/sec) with the IC50 below daily dose of 0.1 mg/kg, i.p. In a similar manner 15K reduced both their invasion and metastases as well, while it had no effect on either body weight or hematological parameters even at 5 mg/kg/day. To the best of our knowledge, 15K is so far the most potent among synthetic PAK1-blockers in vivo, and could be potentially useful for therapy of GEM-resistant cancers.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Prospective severity assessment is legally required in many countries to ensure high-quality research along with high welfare standards for laboratory animals. Mice and rats, the most common laboratory species, are prey animals that usually suppress signs of pain and suffering. Therefore, highly sensitive readout parameters are necessary to adequately quantify distress. The present study compared the performance of different non-invasive methods in determining animal distress, such as measuring body weight, distress score, faecal corticosterone metabolites, burrowing, and nesting behaviour, with continuous monitoring of heart rate, body temperature and activity by telemetry. The distress caused by two surgical interventions was compared and the burden caused by tumour growth was described. Transmitter implantation caused higher distress than laparotomy plus carcinoma cell injection into the pancreas. Surprisingly, no significant increase in distress was observed during tumour growth. The receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed that some non-invasive distress-parameters, i.e., distress-score and burrowing activity, exhibited slightly better performance to quantify distress than the most suitable parameters measured by telemetry. Due to the high burden caused by the implantation of the telemetric device, the use of non-invasive methods to assess distress in laboratory animals after surgical interventions should be favoured in future studies.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'A priority in cancer research is to innovate therapies that are not only effective against tumor progression but also address comorbidities such as cachexia that limit quality and quantity of life. We demonstrate that TLR7/8 agonist R848 induces anti-tumor responses and attenuates cachexia in murine models of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). In vivo, tumors from two of three cell lines were R848-sensitive, resulting in smaller tumor mass, increased immune complexity, increased CD8(+) T-cell infiltration and activity, and decreased Treg frequency. R848-treated mice demonstrated improvements in behavioral and molecular cachexia manifestations, resulting in a near-doubling of survival duration. Knockout mouse studies revealed that stromal, not neoplastic, TLR7 is requisite for R848-mediated responses. In patient samples, we found Tlr7 is ubiquitously expressed in stroma across all stages of pancreatic neoplasia, but epithelial Tlr7 expression is relatively uncommon. These studies indicate immune-enhancing approaches including R848 may be useful in PDAC and cancer-associated cachexia.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'RATIONALE: Pancreatic cancer (PC) is considered as one of the deadliest cancers all over the world. Germline and somatic BRCA1/2 mutations have been widely studied in breast and ovarian carcinomas as they have been found to enhance the risk for disease progression. Olaparib, an oral poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose)polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, has been approved for the treatment strategy of ovarian cancer with any BRCA1/2 mutations. There is a lack of studies which focus on the treatment of other cancer with BRCA-Mutation. PATIENT CONCERNS: This report describes a patient whose presenting complaints were \"Physical examination showed that the pancreas was occupied for one month.\" He initially was diagnosed with stage IV PC based on conventional imaging and pathologic assessment. He had a known germline BRCA 2 mutation, which exhibited a good response to PARP inhibitor therapy. DIAGNOSIS: Through the biopsy histopathological examination, imaging examination, and genetic testing, the patient was diagnosed as metastatic PC with BRCA2 mutation. INTERVENTIONS: He received gemcitabine and albumin-bound paclitaxel chemotherapy from March 15, 2017 to June 30, 2017, and Nivolumab immunotherapy as the maintenance therapy. After serum CA-199 level increased, Olaparib was orally administered from August 17, 2017 to March. After tumor relapsed, he received multiple lines of chemotherapy, including Trametinib Oxaliplatin, S-1, bevacizumab, and irinotecan liposome injection till July 17, 2018. OUTCOMES: We observed the patient had a good progression-free survival (7.4 months); the lesion of the pancreas was classified as partial disease through Olaparib treatment, which indicated significant shrinkage. But it is difficult to conclude whether such therapy could help prolong the overall survival for such patients. LESSONS: The targeted therapy Olaparib showed early signs of potential in treating PC in patients with mutations of the BRCA genes. With emerging therapeutic modalities and next-generation sequencing development, it is increasingly relevant to consider mutation screenings of patients with PC.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Background and Objectives: Both chronic pancreatitis (CP) and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) may lead to cachexia, sarcopenia, and osteoporosis due to different mechanisms. Neither patient gender, age, nor body weight are good predictors of these metabolic changes having a significant negative impact on the quality of life (QOL) and treatment outcomes. The aim of this study was to evaluate radiological changes in body composition and to compare them with manifestations of exocrine and endocrine pancreatic insufficiency, body mass, and QOL among patients with CP and PDAC. Materials and Methods: Prospectively collected data of 100 patients with diagnosed CP or PDAC were used for analysis. All patients underwent dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-C30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) was used to assess QOL. Diabetes and changes in fecal elastase-1 were also assessed. Results: There was no significant difference in skeletal muscle mass (SMM) among patients with CP and PDAC (p = 0.85). Significantly more underweight patients had low SMM (p = 0.002). Patients with CP had more pronounced pancreatic fibrosis (PF) (p < 0.001). Data showed a significant relationship between a high degree of PF and occurrence of diabetes (p = 0.006) and low fecal elastase-1 levels (p = 0.013). A statistically significant lower QOL was determined in patients with PF >/= 50% and in the CP group. Conclusions: Sarcopenia and osteoporosis/osteopenia are highly prevalent among patients with chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer, and CT- and MRI-based assessment of body composition and pancreatic fibrosis could be a potentially useful tool for routine detection of these significant metabolic changes.',\n",

       "  'AB': \"Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a highly fatal cancer with currently limited opportunities for early detection and effective treatment. Modifiable factors may offer pathways for primary prevention. In this study, the association between the Healthy Lifestyle Index (HLI) and PC risk was examined. Within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition cohort, 1113 incident PC (57% women) were diagnosed from 400,577 participants followed-up for 15 years (median). HLI scores combined smoking, alcohol intake, dietary exposure, physical activity and, in turn, overall and central adiposity using BMI (HLI(BMI)) and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR, HLI(WHR)), respectively. High values of HLI indicate adherence to healthy behaviors. Cox proportional hazard models with age as primary time variable were used to estimate PC hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Sensitivity analyses were performed by excluding, in turn, each factor from the HLI score. Population attributable fractions (PAF) were estimated assuming participants' shift to healthier lifestyles. The HRs for a one-standard deviation increment of HLI(BMI) and HLI(WHR) were 0.84 (95% CI: 0.79, 0.89; p(trend) = 4.3e-09) and 0.77 (0.72, 0.82; p(trend) = 1.7e-15), respectively. Exclusions of smoking from HLI(WHR) resulted in HRs of 0.88 (0.82, 0.94; p(trend) = 4.9e-04). The overall PAF estimate was 19% (95% CI: 11%, 26%), and 14% (6%, 21%) when smoking was removed from the score. Adherence to a healthy lifestyle was inversely associated with PC risk, beyond the beneficial role of smoking avoidance. Public health measures targeting compliance with healthy lifestyles may have an impact on PC incidence.\",\n",

       "  'AB': \"Pancreatic cancer is the ninth common malignancy in South Korea. It has a dismal prognosis with a 5-year overall survival rate of less than 10%, and pancreatic cancer is associated with cancer cachexia, which is defined as the loss of muscle mass that is not reversible by conventional nutritional support. Cachexia is noted in over 85% of all pancreatic cancer patients and it is strongly related with the disease's mortality. Nearly 30% of pancreatic cancer deaths are due to cachexia rather than being due to the tumor burden. Therefore, it is crucial to discover the mechanisms behind the development of muscle wasting in pancreatic cancer patients and find novel therapeutics for targeting cachexia. This review deals with the current understanding about the development of cachexia and nutritional support in those patients suffering with pancreatic cancer.\",\n",

       "  'AB': \"Pancreatic cancer is a major cause of cancer-related mortality and morbidity, and its incidence is increasing as the population is aging. On the other hand, significant improvement in the prognosis has not occurred. The absence of early diagnosis means that many patients are diagnosed only when they develop symptoms, such as jaundice, due to a biliary obstruction. The role of endoscopy in multidisciplinary care for patients with pancreatic cancer continues to evolve. Controversy remains regarding the best preoperative biliary drainage in patients with surgically resectable pancreatic head cancer. In general, patients undergoing a surgical resection usually do not require preoperative biliary drainage unless they have cholangitis or receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy. If biliary drainage is performed prior to surgery, the patient's condition and a multidisciplinary approach should be considered. With the increasing life expectancy of patients with pancreatic cancer, the need for more long-time biliary drainage or pre-operative biliary drainage is also increasing. Strong evidence of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) as a first-line and essential treatment for biliary decompression has been provided. On the other hand, the use of endoscopic ultrasound-guided biliary drainage as well as percutaneous biliary drainage has been also recommended. During ERCP, self-expandable metal stent could be recommended instead of a plastic stent for the purpose of long stent patency and minimizing stent-induced complications. In this review, several points of view regarding the relief of obstruction in patients with pancreatic cancer, and optimal techniques are being discussed.\",\n",

       "  'AB': 'AIMS: The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and survival factors of high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) ablation in the treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted between September 2010 and March 2016. Advanced pancreatic cancer patients with HIFU treatment were enrolled in the analysis to evaluate the efficacy of local ablation, pain relief, and relative complications of HIFU therapy. The main factors that affected Overall survival rate (OSR) and median survival time (MST) were also analyzed. RESULTS: Eighty-six patients received HIFU treatment, with a total of 93 treatments performed, and 83 cases were evaluated. Complete response rate (RR) was 3.6% (3/83) and partial RR was 79.5% (66/83). After HIFU treatment, pain reduction was observed in 74 patients, and the total remission rate was 97.6% (74/76). The total MST was 9.9 months (2-58.7 months), the total OSR in 1 and 2 years was 41.5% and 9.6%, respectively. Minor complications occurred in 97.7% (42/43) patients, including transient fever, abdominal pain, skin burn, and amylase elevation. The univariate analysis showed that the clinical stage, treatment method, ablation efficacy, and combined treatment were significant prognostic factors. CONCLUSION: HIFU can significantly alleviate cancer-related pain and prolong the survival time of patients with pancreatic cancer.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'AIMS: The study aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of navigated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided celiac plexus neurolysis (CPN) using a 0.4 T open magnetic resonance system. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed on 23 patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer who underwent MRI-guided CPN between January 2013 and October 2017. Clinical outcomes were evaluated by recording the complications, the opioid intake, and questionnaire before the intervention and at the time point of 1 day, 1 month, and 3 months postprocedure using a numerical visual analog scale (VAS). RESULTS: Navigated MRI guidance allowed the precise placement of needle in the targeted area and the visualization of the injected neurolysis agents for all cases. The VAS scores decreased from 8.8 +/- 1.0 to 2.9 +/- 0.9, 4.2 +/- 1.7, and 4.7 +/- 1.8 at 1 day, 1 month, and 3 months postprocedure (P < 0.05). This intervention reduced the dosage of opioid consumption 1 month after the procedure (52.3 +/- 10.4 mg before the treatment vs. 28.2 +/- 4.9 mg after the treatment; P < 0.001). Treatment-related side effects included hematoma in one patient, short episodes of diarrhea in three patients, and hypotension in four patients. CONCLUSIONS: With the assistance of the navigation system, MRI-guided CPN is a safe and effective treatment approach for managing the upper abdominal pain in patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Improving quality of life (QoL) is an important treatment goal in pancreatic cancer patients. Although the beneficial effects of exercise on QoL are well understood, few studies have investigated more aggressive cancers such as pancreatic cancer. METHODS: Within a randomized trial, we assessed the efficacy of 6-month resistance training on physical functioning (primary outcome) and further QoL-related outcomes. 65 pancreatic cancer patients were assigned to home-based training, supervised training, or a usual care control group. Analysis-of-covariance models on changes from baseline to 6 and 3 months were ap- plied. RESULTS: 47 patients completed the intervention period. After 6 months, no effects of resistance training were observed. However, after 3 months, explorative analyses showed significant between-group mean differences (MD) in favor for resistance training for physical functioning (pooled group: MD=11.0; p=0.016; effect size[ES]=0.31), as well as for global QoL (MD=12.1; p=0.016; effect size=0.56), and other outcomes, such as sleep problems and fatigue. Multiple imputation analyses yielded similar results. Home-based and supervised training performed similarly. CONCLUSION: This first randomized resistance training trial in pancreatic cancer patients indicated clinically relevant improve- ments in QoL after 3 but not after 6 months. Given the severity of pancreatic cancer, exercise recommendations may already commence at surgery.',\n",

Then, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and Western blotting were carried out to measure the expression level of the moesin messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) in PC tissues. The expression levels of matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP-7), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-10 (IL-10) in PC tissues were detected using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit. The relationship between moesin and the pathological stage of patients was analyzed, followed by further analyses on the correlations of moesin with nerve infiltration, tumor location and pain severity of patients with PC. RESULTS: The results of qPCR and Western blotting demonstrated that the expression levels of the moesin mRNA and moesin in PC tissues were evidently higher than those in adjacent tissues (p<0.01). Based on ELISA, the expression levels of MMP-7, TNF-alpha and IL-6 (p<0.01) were significantly higher, while the expression level of IL-10 (p<0.01) was obviously lower in PC tissues compared with those in adjacent tissues. The expression of moesin was closely associated with the pathological stage of patients with PC (p<0.01). The expression level of moesin in PC tissues in patients with nerve infiltration was significantly higher than that of those without nerve infiltration (p<0.01). It was distinctly elevated in PC tissues of patients with tumors located in the tail of the pancreas in comparison with those with tumors located in the head of the pancreas (p<0.01). The pain severity was correlated with the expression level of moesin in PC tissues (p<0.01). CONCLUSION: Moesin affects the progression of PC by activating MMP-7 and further promoting the release of TNF-alpha and IL-6 and decreasing the level of IL-10. The expression of moesin in PC tissues has close relations with the pathological stage of the disease, nerve infiltration, tumor location and pain severity.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Pancreatic tumors are highly desmoplastic and poorly-vascularized, and therefore must develop adaptive mechanisms to sustain their survival under hypoxic condition. Extracellular vesicles (EV) play vital roles in pancreatic tumor pathobiology by facilitating intercellular communication. Here we studied the effect of hypoxia on the release of EVs and examined their role in adaptive survival of pancreatic cancer (PC) cells. Hypoxia promoted the release of EV in PC cell lines, MiaPaCa and AsPC1, wherein former exhibited a far greater induction. Moreover, a time-dependent, measurable and significant increase was recorded for small EV (SEV) in both the cell lines with only minimal induction observed for medium (MEV) and large EVs (LEV). Similarly, noticeable changes in size distribution of SEV were also recorded with a shift toward smaller average size under extreme hypoxia. Thrombospondin (apoptotic bodies marker) was exclusively detected on LEVs, while Arf6 (microvesicles marker) was mostly present on MEV with some expression in LEV as well. However, CD9 and CD63 (exosome markers) were expressed in both SEV and MEVs with a decreased expression recorded under hypoxia. Among all subfractions, SEV was the most bioactive in promoting the survival of hypoxic PC cells and hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha stabilization was involved in heightened EV release under hypoxia and for their potency to promote hypoxic cell survival. Altogether, our findings provide a novel mechanism for the adaptive hypoxic survival of PC cells and should serve as the basis for future investigations on broader functional implications of EV.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Rationale: Emerging evidences have highlighted the critical roles of lncRNAs in human cancer development. The work sought to assess the biological role and potential underlying mechanisms of lncRNA-CF129 (CF129) which is significantly reduced in pancreatic cancer (PC). Methods: CF129 expression and its association with multiple clinicopathologic characteristics in PC specimens were analyzed. The role of CF129 both in vitro and in vivo was assessed, with RNA pull-down and immunoprecipitation assays being performed to detect the interaction between CF129 and p53 and E3 ligase MKRN1. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and luciferase assays were utilized to identify the interaction between p53 and FOXC2 promoter, HIF-1alpha/HDAC1 complex and CF129 promoter, FOXC2 and HIF-1alpha promoter, respectively. Results: CF129 levels were markedly lower in PC compared with paired non-tumor adjacent tissues. Low CF129 expression predicted short overall survival in PC patients. CF129 inhibited invasion and metastasis of PC cells in a FOXC2-dependent manner. In addition, CF129 regulates FOXC2 transcription through association with mutant p53. CF129 directly binds to p53 and E3 ligase MKRN1, and such an interaction leading to p53 protein ubiquitination and degradation. Furthermore, CF129 is a hypoxia-responsive lncRNA, which is transcriptionally downregulated by binding between HIF-1alpha/HDAC1 complex and CF129 promoter. Finally, it is revealed that HIF-1alpha is reciprocally regulated by FOXC2 in transcriptional level. Clinically, CF129 downregulation coordinates overexpression of FOXC2. Conclusions: Our study suggests that CF129 inhibits pancreatic cell proliferation and invasion by suppression of FOXC2 transcription, which depends on MKRN1-mediated ubiquitin-dependent p53 degradation. The HIF-1alpha/CF129/ p53/FOXC2 axis may function as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target.',\n",

       "  'AB': \"BACKGROUND: The link between inflammation and carcinogenesis is indisputable. In trying to understand key factors at play, cancer research has developed an interest in the toll-like receptors (TLRs), which have shown signs of having prognostic value in various adenocarcinomas. We began investigating the expression of toll-like receptors 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 to evaluate their prognostic value of patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). METHODS: We collected tumor biopsies from 154 stage I-III PDAC patients surgically treated at Helsinki University Hospital between 2002 and 2011, excluding patients undergoing neoadjuvant therapy. We used tissue microarray slides and immunohistochemistry to assess expression of TLRs 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 in PDAC tissue. Immunopositivity scores and clinicopathological characteristics were subjected to Fisher's exact test or the linear-by-linear association test. For the survival analysis, we applied the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test, and the Cox regression proportional hazard model served for univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: Strong TLR1 expression was observable in 60 (39%), strong TLR3 in 48 (31%), strong TLR5 in 58 (38%), strong TLR7 in 14 (9%), and strong TLR9 in 22 (14%) patients. The multivariate analysis showed strong TLR1 expression to associate with better survival than moderate, low, or negative expression (HR = 0.68; 95% CI 0.47-0.99; p = 0.044). Additionally, those few patients with tumors negative for TLR1, TLR3, TLR7, or TLR9 fared poorly (HR = 2.41; 95% CI 1.31-4.43; p = 0.005; n = 13). CONCLUSION: Strong TLR1 expression suggested better prognosis in PDAC patients, whereas negative expression of TLR1, TLR3, TLR7, or TLR9 was a sign of poor prognosis.\",\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a particularly lethal malignancy partly due to frequent, severe cachexia. Serum activin correlates with cachexia and mortality, while exogenous activin causes cachexia in mice. METHODS: Isoform-specific activin expression and activities were queried in human and murine tumours and PDAC models. Activin inhibition was by administration of soluble activin type IIB receptor (ACVR2B/Fc) and by use of skeletal muscle specific dominant negative ACVR2B expressing transgenic mice. Feed-forward activin expression and muscle wasting activity were tested in vivo and in vitro on myotubes. RESULTS: Murine PDAC tumour-derived cell lines expressed activin-betaA but not activin-betaB. Cachexia severity increased with activin expression. Orthotopic PDAC tumours expressed activins, induced activin expression by distant organs, and produced elevated serum activins. Soluble factors from PDAC elicited activin because conditioned medium from PDAC cells induced activin expression, activation of p38 MAP kinase, and atrophy of myotubes. The activin trap ACVR2B/Fc reduced tumour growth, prevented weight loss and muscle wasting, and prolonged survival in mice with orthotopic tumours made from activin-low cell lines. ACVR2B/Fc also reduced cachexia in mice with activin-high tumours. Activin inhibition did not affect activin expression in organs. Hypermuscular mice expressing dominant negative ACVR2B in muscle were protected for weight loss but not mortality when implanted with orthotopic tumours. Human tumours displayed staining for activin, and expression of the gene encoding activin-betaA (INHBA) correlated with mortality in patients with PDAC, while INHBB and other related factors did not. CONCLUSIONS: Pancreatic adenocarcinoma tumours are a source of activin and elicit a systemic activin response in hosts. Human tumours express activins and related factors, while mortality correlates with tumour activin A expression. PDAC tumours also choreograph a systemic activin response that induces organ-specific and gene-specific expression of activin isoforms and muscle wasting. Systemic blockade of activin signalling could preserve muscle and prolong survival, while skeletal muscle-specific activin blockade was only protective for weight loss. Our findings suggest the potential and need for gene-specific and organ-specific interventions. Finally, development of more effective cancer cachexia therapy might require identifying agents that effectively and/or selectively inhibit autocrine vs. paracrine activin signalling.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Numerous studies have suggested an association between sarcopenia in pancreatic cancer and adverse outcomes. This systematic review examines the evidence for the impact of sarcopenia on post-operative complications and survival METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted to identify randomised and non-randomised studies of sarcopenia in pancreatic cancer. Meta-analyses of intra- and post-operative outcomes were performed (operating time, all complications, major complications, pancreatic fistulae, peri-operative mortality, overall survival). RESULTS: Forty-two studies reported the assessment of body composition in 7619 patients. Methods used to assess body composition in patients with pancreatic cancers were computerized tomography (n = 34), bioelectrical impedance analysis (n = 7), and dual-energy-X-ray-absorptiometry (n = 1). Only 10 studies reported the impact of pre-operative sarcopenia upon post-operative outcomes. Sarcopenia was associated with increased peri-operative mortality (OR: 2.40, CI(95%):1.19-4.85, p < 0.01) and decreased overall survival by univariable (HR: 1.95, CI(95%):1.35-2.81, p < 0.001) and multivariable analysis (HR: 1.78, CI(95%):1.54-2.05). Sarcopenia was not significantly associated with all complications (OR: 0.96, CI(95%):0.78-1.19) or pancreatic fistula (OR: 0.95, CI(95%): 0.59-1.54). CONCLUSIONS: Assessment of sarcopenia in pancreatic cancer provides prognostic value but, more importantly, may provide a basis for therapeutic intervention. However, variation in the methods of assessing and reporting sarcopenia in this patient group limits the assessment of post-operative outcomes currently.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Early detection methods for pancreatic cancer are lacking. We aimed to develop a prediction model for pancreatic cancer based on changes in health captured by healthcare claims data. METHODS: We conducted a case-control study on 29,646 Medicare-enrolled patients aged 68 years and above with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) reported to the Surveillance Epidemiology an End Results (SEER) tumor registries program in 2004-2011 and 88,938 age and sex-matched controls. We developed a prediction model using multivariable logistic regression on Medicare claims for 16 risk factors and pre-diagnostic symptoms of PDAC present within 15 months prior to PDAC diagnosis. Claims within 3 months of PDAC diagnosis were excluded in sensitivity analyses. We evaluated the discriminatory power of the model with the area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) and performed cross-validation by bootstrapping. RESULTS: The prediction model on all cases and controls reached AUC of 0.68. Excluding the final 3 months of claims lowered the AUC to 0.58. Among new-onset diabetes patients, the prediction model reached AUC of 0.73, which decreased to 0.63 when claims from the final 3 months were excluded. Performance measures of the prediction models was confirmed by internal validation using the bootstrap method. CONCLUSION: Models based on healthcare claims for clinical risk factors, symptoms and signs of pancreatic cancer are limited in classifying those who go on to diagnosis of pancreatic cancer and those who do not, especially when excluding claims that immediately precede the diagnosis of PDAC.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'PURPOSE: Pancreatic cancer has the highest fatality rate of all cancers. Adulthood obesity is an established risk factor for pancreatic cancer; however, life-course obesity is not well understood. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between body mass index (BMI) trajectories throughout the life-course and pancreatic cancer risk. METHODS: A population-based case-control study was conducted (2011-2013) in Ontario, Canada. Cases were recruited from the Ontario pancreas cancer study (n = 310) and controls from the Ontario cancer risk factor study (n = 1258). Questionnaires captured self-reported height and weight at four timepoints (adolescence, 20 s, 30-40 s, 50-60 s). BMI trajectories were identified using latent class growth mixture modeling. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated from multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: Five BMI trajectories were identified: stable-normal weight (38.9%), progressively overweight (42.2%), persistent overweight (12.6%), progressive obesity (4.2%), and persistent obesity (2.1%). The persistent overweight (OR = 1.55; 95% CI 1.02, 2.39) and progressive obesity trajectories (OR = 1.49; 95% CI 0.77, 2.87) compared to stable-normal weight were associated with increased odds of pancreatic cancer. When BMI was evaluated separately the strongest associations with pancreatic cancer emerged in young and mid-adulthood. CONCLUSION: BMI trajectories characterized by overweight in early adulthood were associated with increased pancreatic cancer risk suggesting a life-course approach to disease risk.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Human CLDN18.2 is highly expressed in a significant proportion of gastric and pancreatic adenocarcinomas, while normal tissue expression is limited to the epithelium of the stomach. The restricted expression makes it a potential drug target for the treatment of gastric and pancreatic adenocarcinoma, as evidenced by efforts to target CLDN18.2 via naked antibody and CAR-T modalities. Herein we describe CLDN18.2-targeting via a CD3-bispecific and an antibody drug conjugate and the characterization of these potential therapeutic molecules in efficacy and preliminary toxicity studies. Anti-hCLDN18.2 ADC, CD3-bispecific and diabody, targeting a protein sequence conserved in rat, mouse and monkey, exhibited in vitro cytotoxicity in BxPC3/hCLDN18.2 (IC(50) = 1.52, 2.03, and 0.86 nM) and KATO-III/hCLDN18.2 (IC(50) = 1.60, 0.71, and 0.07 nM) respectively and inhibited tumor growth of pancreatic and gastric patient-derived xenograft tumors. In a rat exploratory toxicity study, the ADC was tolerated up to 10 mg/kg. In a preliminary assessment of tolerability, the anti-CLDN18.2 diabody (0.34 mg/kg) did not produce obvious signs of toxicity in the stomach of NSG mice 4 weeks after dosing. Taken together, our data indicate that targeting CLDN18.2 with an ADC or bispecific modality could be a valid therapeutic approach for the treatment of gastric and pancreatic cancer.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Most advanced elderly cancer patients experience fatigue, anorexia, and declining physical function due to cancer cachexia, for which effective interventions have not been established. We performed a phase I study of a new nonpharmacological multimodal intervention called the nutritional and exercise treatment for advanced cancer (NEXTAC) program and reported the excellent feasibility of and compliance with this program in elderly patients with advanced cancer who were at risk for cancer cachexia. We report here the background, hypothesis, and design of the next-step multicenter, randomized phase II study to evaluate the efficacy of the program, the NEXTAC-TWO study. METHODS: Patients with chemo-naive advanced non-small cell lung cancer or pancreatic cancer, age >/= 70 years, performance status </=2, with adequate organ function and without disability according to the modified Katz index will be eligible. In total, 130 participants will be recruited from 15 Japanese institutions and will be randomized into either the intervention group or a control group. Computer-generated random numbers are allocated to each participant. Stratification factors include performance status (0 to 1 vs. 2), site of primary cancer (lung vs. pancreas), stage (III vs. IV), and type of chemotherapy (cytotoxic vs. others). Interventions and assessment will be performed 4 times every 4 +/- 2 weeks from the date of randomization. Interventions will consist of nutritional counseling, nutritional supplements (rich in branched-chain amino acids), and a home-based exercise program. The exercise program will include low-intensity daily muscle training and lifestyle education to promote physical activity. The primary endpoint is disability-free survival. It is defined as the period from the date of randomization to the date of developing disability or death due to any cause. This trial also plans to evaluate the improvements in nutritional status, physical condition, quality of life, activities of daily living, overall survival, and safety as secondary endpoints. Enrollment began in August 2017. The study results will demonstrate the efficacy of multimodal interventions for elderly cancer patients and their application for the maintenance of physical and nutritional conditions in patients with cancer cachexia. This work is supported by a grant-in-aid from the Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development. DISCUSSION: This is the first randomized trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a multimodal intervention specific for elderly patients with advanced cancer.

       "  'AB': 'Pancreatic cancer (PC) is characterized by racial/ethnic disparities and the debilitating muscle-wasting condition, cancer cachexia. Florida ranks second in the number of PC deaths and has a large and understudied minority population. We examined the primary hypothesis that PC incidence and mortality rates may be highest among Black Floridians and the secondary hypothesis that biological correlates of cancer cachexia may underlie disparities. PC incidence and mortality rates were estimated by race/ethnicity, gender, and county using publicly available state-wide cancer registry data that included approximately 2700 Black, 25 200 Non-Hispanic White (NHW), and 3300 Hispanic/Latino (H/L) Floridians diagnosed between 2004 and 2014. Blacks within Florida experienced a significantly (P < 0.05) higher incidence (12.5/100 000) and mortality (10.97/100 000) compared to NHW (incidence = 11.2/100 000; mortality = 10.3/100 000) and H/L (incidence = 9.6/100 000; mortality = 8.7/100 000), especially in rural counties. To investigate radiologic and blood-based correlates of cachexia, we leveraged data from a subset of patients evaluated at two geographically distinct Florida Cancer Centers. In Blacks compared to NHW matched on stage, markers of PC-induced cachexia were more frequent and included greater decreases in core musculature compared to corresponding healthy control patients (25.0% vs 10.1% lower), greater decreases in psoas musculature over time (10.5% vs 4.8% loss), lower baseline serum albumin levels (3.8 vs 4.0 gm/dL), and higher platelet counts (332.8 vs 268.7 k/UL). Together, these findings suggest for the first time that PC and cachexia may affect Blacks disproportionately. Given its nearly universal contribution to illness and PC-related deaths, the early diagnosis and treatment of cachexia may represent an avenue to improve health equity, quality of life, and survival.',\n",

       "  'AB': \"BACKGROUND: Postoperative chemotherapy is beneficial for many pancreatic cancer patients. However, some patients require dose reduction or the discontinuation of adjuvant chemotherapy because of adverse treatment-related effects. In this study, we aimed to evaluate two main outcomes. First, we evaluated the clinicopathological factors affecting patient disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) following upfront surgery. Second, we evaluated the factors that influence the continuity of adjuvant chemotherapy. METHODS: Fifty-four patients with resected pancreatic cancer were enrolled. First, we evaluated the clinicopathological factors affecting postoperative survival using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression method. Next, factors affecting the continuity of adjuvant chemotherapy were analyzed using multiple logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Univariate and multivariate analyses revealed that positive LN metastasis (HR (95% CI) 6.329 (2.381-16.95); p < 0.001) and relative dose intensity (RDI) < 80% for adjuvant chemotherapy (HR (95% CI) 5.154 (1.761-15.15); p = 0.003) were independent predictive factors for DFS. Regarding OS, extended dissection of the nerve plexus around the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) (HR (95% CI) 4.504 (1.721-11.76); p = 0.002), positive microscopic surgical margin (HR (95% CI) 5.565 (1.724-17.96); p = 0.004), and adjuvant chemotherapy of RDI < 80% (HR (95% CI) 3.534 (1.135-2.667); p = 0.029) were also independent predictive factors. Moreover, the level of RDI significantly correlated with DFS and OS. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that low RDI was significantly associated with postoperative body weight loss (BWL) >/= 10%. CONCLUSIONS: The following factors were significantly associated with poor survival: extended dissection of the nerve plexus around the SMA, lymph node metastasis, residual tumor, and RDI of the adjuvant chemotherapy. Patient's prognosis with adjuvant chemotherapy of RDI < 80% was worse. BWL >/=10% was the most important factor affecting the continuity of adjuvant chemotherapy. Perioperative nutritional intervention is necessary for patients who receive adjuvant chemotherapy for advanced pancreatic cancer.\",\n",

       "  'AB': \"Epidemiological studies suggest that timing of obesity onset - and underlying metabolic dysfunction - is important in determining pancreatic cancer rates: early and young adult abdominal overweight/obesity is more strongly associated with this cancer than obesity that develops later in life. Parental obesity and overweight are associated with metabolic dysfunction and obesity in their children. Here, we evaluated the impact of parental overweight on offspring's susceptibility of pancreatic cancer using the P48Cre/+/KrasG12D/+ mouse model. Male mice were fed an obesity-inducing diet (OID) before conception and mated with females raised on a control diet (CO) to generate the offspring. In a separate experiment, pregnant dams were fed CO or OID throughout gestation. The resulting OID offspring from the maternal (OID-m) or paternal lineage (OID-p) were used to study body weight, metabolic parameters and pancreatic cancer development and for molecular analysis. Parental obesity increased offspring's body weight at birth, weaning and in adulthood compared to CO, with gender- and genotype-specific differences. OID-p and OID-m offspring showed metabolic disorder and accelerated development of high-grade PanIN/PDAC. OID offspring also had higher rates of acinar-to-ductal reprogramming assessed by CPA1+/SOX9+-positive pancreatic cells. Levels of Tenascin C (TNC), an ECM glycoprotein shown to suppress apoptosis, were elevated in OID offspring, particularly females. In line with that, OID offspring displayed increased collagen content and decreased apoptosis in pancreatic lesions compared to CO. An ancestral history of obesity through either the paternal or maternal lineages increases offspring's susceptibility to pancreatic cancer development.\",\n",

       "  'AB': 'Pancreatic cancer (PC) has a very poor prognosis. Surgery is the primary treatment for patients with resectable PC; however, local recurrence, hepatic metastasis, and peritoneal dissemination often occur even after extensive surgery. Adjuvant chemotherapy, typically with gemcitabine, has been used clinically but with only a modest survival benefit. To achieve a better outcome, we investigated the efficacy of (64)Cu-intraperitoneal radioimmunotherapy (ipRIT) with (64)Cu-labeled antiepidermal growth factor receptor antibody cetuximab as an adjuvant treatment after PC surgery using an orthotopic xenografted mouse model. Methods: The efficacy of adjuvant (64)Cu-ipRIT was investigated in a human PC mouse model harboring orthotopic xenografts of xPA-1-DC cells. To reproduce the clinical situation, PC xenografts were surgically resected when pancreatic tumors were readily visible but not metastatic tumors. Increasing doses of (64)Cu-cetuximab were intraperitoneally injected, and the mice were monitored for toxicity to determine the safe therapeutic dose. For adjuvant (64)Cu-ipRIT, the day after tumor resection, the mice were intraperitoneally administered 22.2 MBq of (64)Cu-PCTA-cetuximab and the survival was compared with that in surgery-only controls. For comparison, adjuvant chemotherapy with gemcitabine was also examined using the same model. Results: The mouse model not only developed primary tumors in the pancreas but also subsequently reproduced local recurrence, hepatic metastasis, and peritoneal dissemination after surgery, which is similar to the manifestations that occur with human PC. Adjuvant (64)Cu-ipRIT with (64)Cu-labeled cetuximab after surgery effectively suppressed local recurrence, hepatic metastasis, and peritoneal dissemination in this model. Significant improvement of the survival with minimal toxicity was achieved by adjuvant (64)Cu-ipRIT compared with that in control mice that underwent surgery only. Adjuvant chemotherapy with gemcitabine nominally prolonged the survival, but the effect was not statistically significant. Conclusion:(64)Cu-ipRIT with cetuximab can be an effective adjuvant therapy after PC surgery.',\n",

       "  'AB': \"BACKGROUND: Pancreatic cancer (PC) patients have multiple risk factors for sarcopenia and loss of skeletal muscle mass (LSMM), which may cause greater treatment toxicities, reduced response to cancer therapy, prolonged hospitalization, impaired quality of life, and worse prognosis. METHODS: This is a retrospective study on advanced PC patients treated at the Department of Oncology of Udine, Italy, from January 2012 to November 2017. Among 162 patients who received chemotherapy, 94 consecutive patients with an available computed tomography (CT) scan were retrospectively analyzed. The primary objective of our study was to explore if an early LSMM >/= 10% (measured at first radiological evaluation and compared with baseline) and/or baseline sarcopenia may impact prognosis. Baseline sarcopenia was defined according to Prado's criteria. Skeletal muscle area was measured as cross-sectional areas (cm(2) ) using CT scan data through the Picture archiving and communication system (PACS) image system. RESULTS: In the whole cohort, 48% of patients were </=70 years old, and 50% had metastatic disease. At baseline, 73% of patients had sarcopenia, and 16% presented a visceral fat area >/= 44 cm(2) /m(2) . Overall, 21% experienced an early LSMM >/= 10%. Approximately 33% of sarcopenic patients at baseline and ~35% of patients with early LSMM >/= 10% had a body mass index > 25 kg/m(2) . Of note, 71% of patients were evaluated by a nutritionist, and 56% received a dietary supplementation (oral and/or parenteral). After a median follow-up of 30.44 months, median overall survival (OS) was 11.28 months, whereas median progression-free survival (PFS) was 5.72 months. By multivariate analysis, early LSMM >/= 10% was significantly associated with worse OS [hazard ratio (HR): 2.16; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.23-3.78; P = 0.007] and PFS (HR: 2.31; 95% CI 1.30-4.09; P = 0.004). Moreover, an exploratory analysis showed that inflammatory indexes, such as neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio variation, impact early LSMM >/= 10% (odds ratio 1.31, 95% CI 1.06-1.61, P = 0.010). CONCLUSIONS: Early LSMM >/= 10% has a negative prognostic role in advanced PC patients. Further prospective investigations are needed to confirm these preliminary data.\",\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND:  Locally advanced pancreatic cancer is a life-limiting tumor with a wide range of incapacitating symptoms such as cancer-associated pain. Several local ablative therapies with both thermal and non-thermal sources have recently received significant attention as modern treatment options for local tumor control and symptomatic improvement. The following review article provides an overview of currently available techniques and their outcomes including our own experience with high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) being one of the most exciting and innovative modalities. METHOD:  Our experiences with HIFU treatment are based on 89 pancreatic cancer patients (UICC III-IV). Outcomes such as treatment-related changes in symptoms particularly in cancer pain and quality of life as well as local tumor response, safety and survival were compared to reported studies concerning HIFU, radiofrequency and microwave ablation, cryoablation, irreversible electroporation and stereotactic body radiation therapy. RESULTS:  Even though all strategies appeared to be feasible, the unique feature of noninvasiveness represents a substantial advantage of the HIFU procedure. In 85 % of HIFU-treated patients, long-lasting pain relief was achieved. 50 % of patients did not require any analgesic treatment 6 weeks post-ablation. Unfortunately, pain palliation and quality-of-life outcomes are only rarely reported for other local treatment modalities. Tumor mass reduction could be achieved with all ablative therapies, with a mean tumor volume reduction of 60 % after 6 months in HIFU-treated pancreatic tumors. Differences in treatment-associated morbidity were reported. However, they are only partially comparable due to unbalanced study populations. CONCLUSION:  Various local ablative treatment modalities are available and feasible for tumor mass reduction of advanced pancreatic cancer but with different symptomatic benefit for patients. An effective and long-lasting reduction of cancer-related pain was observed following HIFU without insertion of needles or electrodes. Randomized controlled studies for head-to-head comparison of these modalities are warranted in the near future. KEY POINTS:   . Several ablative therapies are available for the local treatment of inoperable pancreatic cancer.. . Tumor mass and symptom reduction are main goals of local therapies.. . HIFU differs based on its noninvasive approach and low complication rate.. . HIFU enables effective long-lasting pain relief in > 80 % of patients.. . HIFU-associated pain relief is independent of tumor stage and metastatic status.. CITATION FORMAT: . Marinova M, Wilhelm-Buchstab T, Strunk H.

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Up to 80% of pancreatic cancer patients suffer from cachexia, a devastating condition that exacerbates underlying disease, reduces quality of life, and increases treatment complications and mortality. Tumour-induced inflammation is linked to this multifactorial wasting syndrome, but mechanisms and effective treatments remain elusive. Myeloid differentiation factor (MyD88), a key component of the innate immune system, plays a pivotal role in directing the inflammatory response to various insults. In this study, we tested whether MyD88 signalling is essential in the development of pancreatic cancer cachexia using a robust mouse tumour model. METHODS: Sex, age, and body weight-matched wide type (WT) and MyD88 knockout (MyD88 KO) mice were orthotopically or intraperitoneally implanted with a pancreatic tumour cell line from a syngeneic C57BL/6 KRAS(G12D/+) P53(R172H/+) Pdx-Cre (KPC) mouse. We observed the effects of MyD88 signalling during pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma progression and the cachexia development through behavioural, histological, molecular, and survival aspects. RESULTS: Blocking MyD88 signalling greatly ameliorated pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma-associated anorexia and fatigue, attenuated lean mass loss, reduced muscle catabolism and atrophy, diminished systemic and central nervous system inflammation, and ultimately improved survival. Our data demonstrate that MyD88 signalling plays a critical role in mediating pancreatic cancer-induced inflammation that triggers cachexia development and therefore represents a promising therapeutic target. CONCLUSIONS: MyD88-dependent inflammation is crucial in the pathophysiology of pancreatic cancer progression and contributes to high mortality. Our findings implicate the importance of innate immune signalling pathways in pancreatic cancer cachexia and a novel therapeutic target.',\n",

We additionally show that the use of an anti-CEA antibody conjugated to the near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent dye, IRDye800CW, can selectively highlight the pancreatic cancer and its metastases in this model with a tumor-to-background ratio of 3.5 (SEM 0.9).

       "  'AB': \"BACKGROUND: Among all the abdominal cancers, pancreatic cancer is the second most common one. Majority of the patients present with an excruciating pain when they are diagnosed with the disease. Coeliac plexus neurolysis (CPN) is a procedure that can control the pain in pancreatic cancer while precluding further consumption of analgesics in higher doses and quantity. The procedure of neurolysis is performed by injecting phenol/alcohol into the coeliac plexus ganglionic neural network. There is a high proportion of pain relief with CPN in up to 80% of the patients. AIM: The aim of our study is to assess the pain relief after CPN, reduction in analgesics consumption and evaluation of patient satisfaction post procedure. METHODS: A cross sectional study was done and we collected the retrospective data from December 2016 to November 2017. A total of 35 patients of either gender (male and female) were included in this study. Neurolysis was done with transcrural approach using 6% phenol. Follow up of patients was done after 1 and 4 weeks of the procedure. The patients were evaluated for pain scores on numeric rating scale (NRS), reduction in analgesia and patient satisfaction regarding the procedure and pain relief. The analysis was based on mean values. RESULTS: Total numbers of patients were 35. The mean age was 54.11+/-12.51 (SD) years with a male to female percentage of 31.43% and 68.57%. Follow up was done after 1 week and 4 weeks. Patients reported decrease in mean pain score (1 from 9 in Males and 0 from 9 in Females), reduction in analgesics (81.8% among Males and 18.2% among Females) and over all patient's satisfaction was (72.7% Males and 27.3% Females). CONCLUSIONS: It has been observed from the results that CPN works effectively for pancreatic cancer patients. There is a strong recommendation of neurolysis in patients with pancreatic cancer pain as it improves the pain scores, significant reduction in analgesia consumption with good patient satisfaction.\",\n",

       "  'AB': \"BACKGROUND: Increasing incidence and mortality rates of pancreatic cancer (PC) highlight an urgent need for novel and efficient drugs. Retention in endoplasmic reticulum 1 (RER1) is an important retention factor in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). However, it remains elusive whether RER1 is involved in the retention of disease-related proteins. METHODS: We analyzed the expression level of RER1 in PC and adjacent tissues, and also employed Kaplan-Meier's analysis to identify the correlation between RER1 expression and overall survival rate. Cell proliferation, colony formation, tumor formation, scratch test, and transwell invasion assays were performed in RER1 knockdown cells and negative control cells. RESULTS: We hereby reported the important functions of RER1 in tumorigenesis and metastasis of PC, evidenced by inhibitory effects of RER1 knockdown on PC cell proliferation, migration and aggressiveness. Tumor formation was also significantly repressed in RER1 knockdown cells compared to control. Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha was found to be an upstream regulator of RER1. Knockdown HIF-1alpha cells exhibited similar repressive impact on cell proliferation as RER1, and showed diminished migratory and invasive abilities under hypoxic condition. CONCLUSION: The present study has demonstrated that RER1 enhances the progression of PC through promoting cell proliferation, migration and aggressiveness.\",\n",

       "  'AB': 'OBJECTIVES: Older patients make up the majority of patients with pancreatic cancer, with a median age of 71\\u202fyears at diagnosis. However, older patients are underrepresented in clinical trials in pancreatic cancer. This study investigates trends in age distribution of patients enrolled in clinical trials for advanced pancreatic cancer over time, and examines outcomes and toxicity in older patient subgroups from two studies conducted by Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group and American College of Radiology Imaging Network (ECOG-ACRIN) in this disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 16,042 patients from 38 phase III clinical trials for locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma published between 1997 and 2016 were identified and included in this analysis. Outcomes and toxicity by age were examined in two of the trials, ECOG-ACRIN trials E2297 and E6201, which included a total of 1146 patients. RESULTS: The median age across the trials was 62.7\\u202fyears; median ages for individual trials ranged from 57\\u202fyears to 66\\u202fyears. Weighted linear regression showed no significant change in median age over time. Combined analysis of the two ECOG-ACRIN trials demonstrated higher rates of fatigue, thrombocytopenia, and infection in those >/=75\\u202fyears compared with those <75\\u202fyears, but despite this showed no difference in overall survival (OS) or progression-free survival (PFS) (OS: 5.7 vs. 5.6\\u202fmonths and PFS: 2.8 vs 3.5\\u202fmonths). CONCLUSIONS: Enrollment of older adults in phase III pancreatic cancer clinical trials has not increased over time, despite increasing number of older patients seen in clinic. Increased efforts are needed to enhance enrollment of older patients in clinical trials, and to promote trials specifically for older patients, in order to improve the evidence base for treating this patient population.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Pancreatic cancer (PC) is among foremost causes of cancer related deaths worldwide due to generic symptoms, lack of effective screening strategies and resistance to chemo- and radiotherapies. The risk factors associated with PC include several metabolic disorders such as obesity, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Studies have shown that obesity and T2DM are associated with PC pathogenesis; however, their role in PC initiation and development remains obscure. MAIN BODY: Several biochemical and physiological factors associated with obesity and/or T2DM including adipokines, inflammatory mediators, and altered microbiome are involved in PC progression and metastasis albeit by different molecular mechanisms. Deep understanding of these factors and causal relationship between factors and altered signaling pathways will facilitate deconvolution of disease complexity as well as lead to development of novel therapies. In the present review, we focuses on the interplay between adipocytokines, gut microbiota, adrenomedullin, hyaluronan, vanin and matrix metalloproteinase affected by metabolic alteration and pancreatic tumor progression. CONCLUSIONS: Metabolic diseases, such as obesity and T2DM, contribute PC development through altered metabolic pathways. Delineating key players in oncogenic development in pancreas due to metabolic disorder could be a beneficial strategy to combat cancers associated with metabolic diseases in particular, PC.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'The most frequent pancreatic cancer is pancreatic adenocarcinoma. It has high and early locally and distant invasiveness; this is the reason why it often shows little sign or symptoms in early stage and poor prognosis after the diagnosis, frequently in advanced stage. Although it is possible to detect this tumor in early stage because of its neoplastic precursor (PanINs). Epidemiological data shows that pancreatic cancer is not very common but obvious it is one of the most neoplastic death-cause in the world. The trend of incidence is quite increasing through years, proportionally to the increase of risk factors. About risk factors, it is not easy to detect in all the cases but it is known the role of some of that: there are hereditary risk factors, such as genetic pattern like HBOC, HNPCC, FAP, PJS, FAMMM, HP and CF and environmental ones (modifiable) such as smoke, alcohol consumption, chronic pancreatitis, obesity and diabetes mellitus. This narrative review aims to analyze the epidemiological data of pancreatic cancer and associated risk factors.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Cachexia is a wasting syndrome characterized by involuntary loss of >5% body weight due to depletion of adipose and skeletal muscle mass. In cancer, the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) is considered a mediator of cachexia and a potential biomarker, but the relationship between IL-6, weight loss, and cancer stage is unknown. In this study we sought to evaluate IL-6 as a biomarker of cancer cachexia while accounting for disease progression. METHODS: We retrospectively studied 136 subjects with biopsy-proven pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), considering the high prevalence of cachexia is this population. Clinical data were abstracted from subjects in all cancer stages, and plasma IL-6 levels were measured using a multiplex array and a more sensitive ELISA. Data were evaluated with univariate comparisons, including Kaplan-Meier survival curves, and multivariate Cox survival models. RESULTS: On multiplex, a total of 43 (31.4%) subjects had detectable levels of plasma IL-6, while by ELISA all subjects had detectable IL-6 levels. We found that increased plasma IL-6 levels, defined as detectable for multiplex and greater than median for ELISA, were not associated with weight loss at diagnosis, but rather with the presence of metastasis (p\\u202f<\\u202f0.001 for multiplex and p\\u202f=\\u202f0.007 for ELISA). Further, while >5% weight loss was not associated with worse survival, increased plasma IL-6 by either methodology was. CONCLUSION: Circulating IL-6 levels do not correlate with cachexia (when defined by weight loss), but rather with advanced cancer stage. This suggests that IL-6 may mediate wasting, but should not be considered a diagnostic biomarker for PDAC-induced cachexia.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: There is growing concern regarding the impact of adolescent obesity on adult health. The objective of this study was to evaluate the association between body mass index (BMI) in late adolescence and the incidence of pancreatic cancer during adulthood. METHODS: The authors analyzed a cohort of 1087,358 Israeli Jewish men and 707,212 Jewish women who underwent a compulsory physical examination between ages 16 and 19 years from 1967 to 2002. Pancreatic cancer incidence through December 31, 2012 was identified by linkage to the national cancer registry. Multivariable-adjusted Cox regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for pancreatic cancer according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) BMI percentiles at baseline. RESULTS: Over a median 23 year follow-up, 551 incident cases of pancreatic cancer cases occurred (423 men; 128 women). Compared with normal weight (5th to-<85th percentile), obesity (>/=95th percentile) was associated with an increased risk of cancer among both men (HR, 3.67; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.52-5.34) and women (HR, 4.07; 95% CI, 1.78-9.29). Among men, compared with low-normal BMI (>/=5th to <25th percentile), high-normal BMI (>/=75th to <85th percentile) and overweight (85th to 95th percentile) also were associated with a higher risk for cancer(high-normal BMI: HR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.05-2.13; overweight: HR, 1.97; 95% CI, 1.39-2.80). The estimated population-attributable fraction because of overweight and obesity was 10.9% (95% CI, 6.1%-15.6%). CONCLUSIONS: Men and women who were obese or overweight as adolescents are at an increased risk for subsequent pancreatic cancer.',\n",

About 80% of pancreatic cancer patients exhibit cachectic phenotype at the time of diagnosis. Here, we present the several molecular and physiological parameters, which we utilize to study the pancreatic cancer-induced cachexia in in vitro models and preclinical mice models of pancreatic cancer. We have described myotube and adipocyte-based in vitro models of muscle and fat wasting, including methods of cell culture, differentiation, and treatment with cancer cell-conditioned medium. Furthermore, we have explained the methods of evaluation of key cachectic markers for muscles. Next, we have detailed the orthotopic implantation mouse models of pancreatic cancer and evaluation of different physiological parameters, including body weight, food intake, body composition analysis, glucose tolerance test, insulin resistance test, grip strength measurement, and rotarod performance test. We have also explained morphological parameters and molecular markers to evaluate the muscle wasting in pancreatic cancer-induced cachexia.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Cancer and obesity are the two major epidemics of the 21st century. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the leading causes of death, with a five-year overall survival rate of only 8%. Its incidence and mortality have increased in recent years, and this cancer type is expected to be among the top five leading causes of cancer-related death by 2030 in the United States (US). In the last three decades, the prevalence of overweight people has boosted with a consequent increase in obesity-related diseases. Considerable epidemiologic evidence correlates overweight and obese conditions to an increased risk of several types of cancer, including PDAC. Besides being a risk factor for multiple metabolic disorders, the tumor-promoting effects of obesity occur at the local level via inflammatory mediators that are associated with adipose inflammation and metabolic or hormones mediators and microbiota dysbiosis. Although an excess of body mass index (BMI) represents the second most modifiable risk factor for PDAC with an increased cancer related-death of more than 20(-)40%, still little is known about the molecular mechanisms that underlie this strong association. In this review, we focused on the role of obesity as a preventable risk factor of PDAC, discussing the molecular mechanisms linking obesity to cancer initiation and progression. Moreover, we highlighted the role of obesity in defining chemoresistance, showing how a high BMI can actually reduce response to chemotherapy.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Chronic pancreatitis is an inflammatory condition of the pancreas with clinical manifestations ranging from abdominal pain, acute pancreatitis, exocrine and/or endocrine dysfunction, and pancreatic cancer. There is a need for longitudinal studies in well-phenotyped patients to ascertain the utility of cross-sectional imaging findings of chronic pancreatitis for diagnosis and assessment of disease severity. CT and MR cholangiopancreatography are the most common cross-sectional imaging studies performed for the evaluation of chronic pancreatitis. Currently, there are no universal reporting standards for chronic pancreatitis. Several features of chronic pancreatitis are applied clinically, such as calcifications, parenchymal T1 signal changes, focal or diffuse gland atrophy, or irregular contour of the gland. Such findings have not been incorporated into standardized diagnostic criteria. There is also lack of consensus on quantification of disease severity in chronic pancreatitis, other than by using ductal features alone as described in the Cambridge classification. The Consortium for the Study of Chronic Pancreatitis, Diabetes, and Pancreatic Cancer (CPDPC) was established by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases and the National Cancer Institute in 2015 to undertake collaborative studies on chronic pancreatitis, diabetes mellitus, and pancreatic adenocarcinoma. CPDPC investigators from the Adult Chronic Pancreatitis Working Group were tasked with development of a new consensus approach to reporting features of chronic pancreatitis aimed to standardize diagnosis and assessment of disease severity for clinical trials. This consensus statement presents and defines features of chronic pancreatitis along with recommended reporting metrics. (c) RSNA, 2018 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

       "  'AB': 'PURPOSE: We sought to assess whether machine learning-based classification approaches can improve the classification of pancreatic tumor models relative to more simplistic analysis methods, using T(1) relaxation, CEST, and DCE MRI. METHODS: The T(1) relaxation time constants, % CEST at five saturation frequencies, and vascular permeability constants from DCE MRI were measured from Hs 766 T, MIA PaCa-2, and SU.86.86 pancreatic tumor models. We used each of these measurements as predictors for machine learning classifier algorithms. We also used principal component analysis to reduce the dimensionality of entire CEST spectra and DCE signal evolutions, which were then analyzed using classification methods. RESULTS: The T(1) relaxation time constants, % CEST amplitudes at specific saturation frequencies, and the relative K(trans) and k(ep) values from DCE MRI could not classify all three tumor types. However, the area under the curve from DCE signal evolutions could classify each tumor type. Principal component analysis was used to analyze the entire CEST spectrum and DCE signal evolutions, which predicted the correct tumor model with 87.5% and 85.1% accuracy, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Machine learning applied to the entire CEST spectrum improved the classification of the three tumor models, relative to classifications that used % CEST values at single saturation frequencies. A similar improvement was not attained with machine learning applied to T(1) relaxation times or DCE signal evolutions, relative to more simplistic analysis methods.',\n",

       "  'AB': \"BACKROUND: The role of sarcopenia and sarcopenic obesity in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma(PDAC) remains controversial. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Medline and Web of Science were searched for studies reporting survival in sarcopenic and/or sarcopenic obese patients with pancreatic cancer. Primary outcome was mortality in patients with sarcopenia and/or sarcopenic obesity versus non-sarcopenic and/or non-sarcopenic obese patients. Secondary outcome was the incidence of major postoperative complications. RESULTS: Eleven studies comprising 2.297 patients were considered suitable for inclusion. Overall 959 of 2.111(45.4%) patients were defined as sarcopenic and 163 of 1.254(13%) as sarcopenic obese. Patients' age was above 60 years(range 63-69) with a male proportion ranging from 50.8% to 68.0%. Of 2.297 patients, 958(41.7%) underwent palliative treatment, 1.339(58.3%) curative resections. Follow-up ranged from 11 to 57.7 months. Median overall survival ranged from 4.3 to 12 months in palliative patients and 17.4 to 25.8 months after curative resection. Overall proportions of sarcopenic patients varied from 21.3% to 65.3%. Sarcopenia was significantly associated with poorer overall survival(HR 1.49; 95%CI 1.27-1.74,p<0.001). Sarcopenic obesity was reported in 0.6% to 25.0% of patients, and was also significantly associated with poorer overall survival(HR 2.01; 95%CI 1.55-2.61,p<0.001). The incidence of major complications ranged from 8.6% to 33.9%. Rates of clinically relevant(grade B/C) postoperative pancreatic fistulas varied from 8.3% to 17.8%. Sarcopenic obesity was an independent predictor of major postoperative complications in one study, in another study sarcopenia was significantly associated with clinically relevant pancreatic fistulas. CONCLUSIONS: Sarcopenia and sarcopenic obesity are significantly associated with poorer overall survival in patients with PDAC.\",\n",

       "  'AB': 'PURPOSE: Gemcitabine is currently the standard first-line chemotherapeutic drug for treating pancreatic cancer. However, many factors can contribute to gemcitabine resistance. One of the most important reasons is the low hENT1 expression. In this study, we tested the antitumor effect of gemcitabine-loaded human serum albumin nanoparticle (GEM-HSA-NP) on gemcitabine-resistant pancreatic cancer induced by low hENT1 expression. MATERIALS AND METHODS: S-(4-nitrobenzyl)-6-thioinosine was utilized to inhibit the activity of hENT1 and simulate low hENT1 expression. Growth inhibition assays and cell cycle and apoptosis analyses were performed on human pancreatic cancer cell lines such as BxPC-3 and SW1990. The in vivo antitumor effect was studied by using patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models. The in vivo toxicity assessment was performed on healthy Kunming mice. RESULTS: In in vitro studies, GEM-HSA-NP showed its ability to inhibit cell proliferation, arrest cell cycle and induce apoptosis when tumor cells were resistant to gemcitabine. In in vivo studies, GEM-HSA-NP was more effective than gemcitabine on inhibiting tumor growth whether the expression levels of hENT1 were high or low in PDX models. The in vivo toxicity assessment showed that the biotoxicity of GEM-HSA-NP did not increase compared with gemcitabine. CONCLUSION: GEM-HSA-NP can overcome gemcitabine resistance induced by low hENT1 expression, which suggests its potential role for the clinical application.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Pancreatic cancer has a very high mortality rate worldwide, and about 30-40% of all patients have extensive vascular involvement at initial diagnosis that precludes surgical intervention. Here, we describe our experience in a patient with locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC) who underwent R0 conversion surgery after undergoing a combination of chemotherapy and carbon-ion radiotherapy (CIRT), which led to long-term relapse-free survival (23 months). CASE PRESENTATION: A 41-year-old woman presented a month ago with epigastralgia referred to our facility and was subsequently diagnosed with pancreatic cancer cStage III (Ph, TS2 (35 mm), cT4, cCH1, cDU1, cS1, cRP1, cPL1, cVsm0, cAsm1, cN0, cM0) that was also categorized as an unresectable LAPC. She immediately underwent 3 cycles of induction chemotherapy (gemcitabine + nanoparticle albumin-bound (nab-) paclitaxel) followed by CIRT with concurrent gemcitabine. Although significant shrinkage of the primary tumor occurred, frequent cholangitis due to duodenal stenosis of unknown etiology prevented continued chemotherapy, and 9 months after the first visit, she underwent a radical, subtotal, stomach-preserving, pancreaticoduodenectomy (SSPPD). Histopathologic examination of the resected tissue revealed a R0 resection with a histological response of Evans grade IIB. She was administered an almost full dose of S-1 as adjuvant chemotherapy for 6 months and has shown no signs of recurrence in 23 months. CONCLUSIONS: We report a first case of successful conversion surgery for an initially unresectable LAPC after rapid induction GEM + nab-PTX chemotherapy followed by CIRT. Rapid induction GEM + nab-PTX chemotherapy followed by CIRT for LAPC might be a safe and effective treatment option.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Pancreatic cancer is the third leading cause of cancer death in the United States, with projections that it will become the second leading cause by the year 2030. It carries a dismal prognosis with a 5-year overall survival rate of less than 9% and is associated with numerous comorbidities, the most notable being cachexia. Defined as the loss of muscle mass not reversible by conventional nutritional support, cachexia is seen in over 85% of pancreatic cancer patients and contributes significantly to mortality, where nearly 30% of pancreatic cancer deaths are due to cachexia rather than tumor burden. Therefore, there is an urgent need to identify the mechanisms behind the development of muscle wasting in pancreatic cancer patients and design novel therapeutics targeting cachexia. This review highlights the current understanding surrounding the mechanisms underpinning the development of cachexia in pancreatic cancer, as well as the current mouse models of pancreatic cancer-induced muscle wasting described in the literature.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and aging are associated with pancreatic cancer risk, but the mechanisms of pancreatic cancer development caused by these factors are not clearly understood. Syrian golden hamsters are susceptible to N-nitrosobis(2-oxopropyl)amine (BOP)-induced pancreatic carcinogenesis. Aging, BOP treatment and/or a high-fat diet cause severe and scattered fatty infiltration (FI) of the pancreas with abnormal adipokine production and promote pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) development. The KK-A(y) mouse, a T2DM model, also develops severe and scattered FI of the pancreas. Treatment with BOP induced significantly higher cell proliferation in the pancreatic ducts of KK-A(y) mice, but not in those of ICR and C57BL/6J mice, both of which are characterized by an absence of scattered FI. Thus, we hypothesized that severely scattered FI may be involved in the susceptibility to PDAC development. Indeed, severe pancreatic FI, or fatty pancreas, is observed in humans and is associated with age, body mass index (BMI) and DM, which are risk factors for pancreatic cancer. We analyzed the degree of FI in the non-cancerous parts of PDAC and non-PDAC patients who had undergone pancreatoduodenectomy by histopathology and demonstrated that the degree of pancreatic FI in PDAC cases is significantly higher than that in non-PDAC controls. Moreover, the association with PDAC is positive, even after adjusting for BMI and the prevalence of DM. Accumulating evidence suggests that pancreatic FI is involved in PDAC development in animals and humans, and further investigations to clarify the genetic and environmental factors that cause pancreatic FI are warranted.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: By the traditional definition of unintended weight loss, cachexia develops in ~80% of patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Here, we measure the longitudinal body composition changes in patients with advanced PDAC undergoing 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin therapy. METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of 53 patients with advanced PDAC on 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin as first line therapy at Indiana University Hospital from July 2010 to August 2015. Demographic, clinical, and survival data were collected. Body composition measurement by computed tomography (CT), trend, univariate, and multivariate analysis were performed. RESULTS: Among all patients, three cachexia phenotypes were identified. The majority of patients, 64%, had Muscle and Fat Wasting (MFW), while 17% had Fat-Only Wasting (FW) and 19% had No Wasting (NW). NW had significantly improved overall median survival (OMS) of 22.6 months vs. 13.0 months for FW and 12.2 months for MFW (P = 0.02). FW (HR = 5.2; 95% confidence interval = 1.5-17.3) and MFW (HR = 1.8; 95% confidence interval = 1.1-2.9) were associated with an increased risk of mortality compared with NW. OMS and risk of mortality did not differ between FW and MFW. Progression of disease, sarcopenic obesity at diagnosis, and primary tail tumours were also associated with decreased OMS. On multivariate analysis, cachexia phenotype and chemotherapy response were independently associated with survival. Notably, CT-based body composition analysis detected tissue loss of >5% in 81% of patients, while the traditional definition of >5% body weight loss identified 56.6%. CONCLUSIONS: Distinct cachexia phenotypes were observed in this homogeneous population of patients with equivalent stage, diagnosis, and first-line treatment. This suggests cellular, molecular, or genetic heterogeneity of host or tumour. Survival among patients with FW was as poor as for MFW, indicating adipose tissue plays a crucial role in cachexia and PDAC mortality. Adipose tissue should be studied for its mechanistic contributions to cachexia.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Gemcitabine (GEM) is first-line therapy for pancreatic cancer but has limited efficacy in most cases. Nanoparticle-albumin bound (nab)-paclitaxel is becoming first-line therapy for pancreatic cancer, but also has limited efficacy for pancreatic cancer. Our goal was to improve the treatment outcome in patient-like models of pancreatic cancer. We previously established patient-derived orthotopic xenografts (PDOX) pancreatic cancers from two patients. The pancreatic tumor was implanted orthotopically in the pancreatic tail of nude mice to establish the PDOX models. Five weeks after implantation, 50 PDOX mouse models were randomized into five groups of 10 mice for each pancreatic cancer PDOX: untreated control; GEM (100 mg/kg, i.p., once a week for 2 weeks); GEM + nab-PTX (GEM: 100 mg/kg, i.p., once a week for 2 weeks, nab-PTX: 10 mg/kg, i.v., twice a week for 2 weeks); S. typhimurium A1-R (5 x 10(7) CFU/100 mul, i.v., once a week for 2 weeks); GEM + S. typhimurium A1-R (GEM: 100 mg/kg, i.p., once a week for 2 weeks, S. typhimurium A1-R; 5 x 10(7) CFU/100 mul, i.v., once a week for 2 weeks). GEM + nab-PTX was significantly more effective than GEM alone in one PDOX model (p = 0.0004), but there was no significant difference in the other PDOX model. The combination of GEM + S. typhimurium A1-R regressed both PDOX models. These results show S. typhimurium A1-R can overcome the ineffectiveness or partial effectiveness of GEM in patient-like models of pancreatic cancer and demonstrate clinical potential for this combination.',\n",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of Abraxane((R)) (nab-paclitaxel) in Italian patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer (MPC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 80 patients. Overall survival (OS) was the primary end point for evaluating the efficacy of nab-paclitaxel in combination with gemcitabine treatment, while carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9) reduction, safety, progression-free survival (PFS), overall response rate and reduction in pain were secondary end points. RESULTS: The median OS was 8 months, and the median PFS was 5 months. A considerable difference in CA 19-9 before and after treatment was observed. Descriptive and correlation analyses were done to examine the relationship between CA 19-9 response and OS. Linear regression analysis between OS and CA 19-9 response revealed that CA 19-9 is an important predictor of OS, showing a positive correlation. CONCLUSION: Nab-paclitaxel is a well-tolerated and effective treatment for patients affected by MPC. The drug showed an improved tolerability profile, significant pain relief and an increase in survival rate.',\n",

Here, we assess resistance to therapeutic inhibition of the PI3K pathway within the hypoxic microenvironment of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and identify a phenomenon whereby pronounced hypoxia-induced resistance is observed for three clinically relevant inhibitors. To address this clinical problem, we have mapped tumor hypoxia by both immunofluorescence and phosphorescence lifetime imaging of oxygen-sensitive nanoparticles and demonstrate that these hypoxic regions move transiently around the tumor. To overlay this microenvironmental information with drug response, we applied a FRET biosensor for Akt activity, which is a key effector of the PI3K pathway. Performing dual intravital imaging of drug response in different tumor compartments, we demonstrate an improved drug response to a combination therapy using the dual mTORC1/2 inhibitor AZD2014 with the hypoxia-activated pro-drug TH-302.',\n",

In the setting of pancreatic cancer, NBTE is more commonly diagnosed postmortem. We describe a case of a man who was diagnosed with pancreatic carcinoma after incidental finding of NBTE. Imaging incidentally revealed multiple strokes, bilateral renal and splenic infarcts, while subsequent workup for cardioembolic source demonstrated a 1.1x0.7 cm mitral valve vegetation. As multiple blood cultures were sterile and patient lacked clinical signs of infection, an underlying malignancy was suspected. CT abdomen demonstrated a dilated pancreatic duct, MRI showed a 2.8x2.2 cm pancreatic head mass. Endoscopic biopsy of the mass revealed pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Other than NBTE, there were no other clinical or laboratory findings to clearly suggest pancreatic cancer. Thus, incidental discovery of this mitral valve vegetation led to the diagnosis of pancreatic malignancy.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'FOLFIRINOX has been one of the first-line options for advanced pancreatic cancer, even though it induces significant adverse effects. Several institutions have begun using modified FOLFIRINOX to decrease its side effects and increase its tolerability. We systematically investigated the outcome from patients who initially received modified FOLFIRINOX as a chemotherapy regimen for advanced pancreatic cancer. We used the random-model generic inverse variance method to analyse the binary data with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Eleven studies were included in the meta-analysis with 563 total patients. The 6-month and 1-year overall survival (OS) rates of locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC) were 90.9% and 76.2%. The 6-month and 1-year progression-free survival (PFS) rates of LAPC were 81.5% and 48.5%. The 6-month and 1-year OS rates of metastatic pancreatic cancer (MPC) were 79.7% and 47.6%. The 6-month and 1-year PFS rates of MPC were 56.3% and 20.6%. The following rates were also calculated: complete response rate (CR): 2.9%; partial response rate (PR): 35.9%; stable disease rate (SD): 41.2%; overall response rate (OR): 34.6%; disease control rate (DCR): 76.7%; progressive disease: 23.1%; and grade III/IV adverse events (AEs): neutropenia 23.1%, febrile neutropenia 4.8%, thrombocytopenia 4.8%, anaemia 5.7%, fatigue 11.5%, nausea 9.1%, diarrhoea 10.1%, vomiting 5.7%, neuropathy 3.8%, and increased ALT 5.7%. In conclusion, modified FOLFIRINOX could provide comparative survival benefits with fewer adverse events compared to the conventional dosage.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Combination therapy with oxaliplatin, irinotecan, fluorouracil, and leucovorin (FOLFIRINOX) chemotherapy drastically improves survival of advanced pancreatic cancer patients. However, the efficacy of FOLFIRINOX as a second-line treatment after gemcitabine failure has not been tested prospectively. We investigated the feasibility and safety of attenuated FOLFIRINOX in patients with gemcitabine-refractory advanced pancreatic cancer. METHODS: A multicenter phase II prospective open-label, single-arm study was conducted at 14 hospitals. Patients with histologically proven invasive ductal pancreatic adenocarcinoma, a measurable or evaluable lesion, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 or 1, adequate organ function, and aged 19 years or older were eligible. Attenuated FOLFIRINOX consisted of oxaliplatin 65 mg/m(2), irinotecan 135 mg/m(2), and leucovorin 400 mg/m(2) injected intravenously on day 1 and 5-fluorouracil 2000 mg/m(2) continuously infused intravenously over 46 h on days 1-2, repeated every 2 weeks. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival from the initiation of FOLFIRINOX. Secondary endpoints were the objective response rate, disease control rate, overall survival, safety, and tolerability. We estimated overall survival and progression-free survival using the Kaplan-Meier methods. RESULTS: We enrolled 39 patients from 14 institutions. The objective response rate was 10.3%, while the disease control rate was 64.1%. The 6-month and 1-year overall survival rates were 59.0% and 15.4%, respectively. Median progression-free survival and overall survival were 3.8 months (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.5-6.0 months) and 8.5 months (95% CI 5.6-11.4 months), respectively. Grade 3 or 4 adverse events were neutropenia (41.0%), nausea (10.3%), anorexia (10.3%), anemia (7.7%), mucositis (7.7%), pneumonia/pleural effusion (5.1%), and fatigue (5.1%). One treatment-related death attributable to septic shock occurred. CONCLUSION: Attenuated FOLFIRINOX may be promising as a second-line therapy for gemcitabine-refractory pancreatic cancer.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Pain caused by infiltrating pancreatic cancer is complex in nature and may therefore be difficult to treat. In addition to conventional analgesics, neurolytic blockade of the coeliac plexus is often recommended. However, different techniques are advocated, and procedures vary, and the results may therefore be difficult to compare. Therefore strong evidence for the effect of this treatment is still lacking, and more studies are encouraged. Our aim was to describe our technique and procedures using a Computer Tomograph (CT) guided procedure with a dorsal approach and present the results. METHODS: The procedures were performed in collaboration between a radiologist and an anaesthesiologist. All patients had advanced pancreatic cancer. The patients were placed in prone position on pillows, awake and monitored. Optimal placement of injection needles was guided by CT, and the radiologist injected a small dose of contrast as a control. When optimal needle position, the anaesthesiologist took over and completed the procedure. At first 40 mg methylprednisolone was injected to prevent inflammation. Thereafter a mixture of 99% ethanol diluted to 50% by ropivacaine 7.5 mg/mL to a total amount of 20-30 mL per needle was slowly injected. Repeated aspiration was performed during injection to avoid intravasal injection. Pain treatment and pain score was recorded and compared before and after the treatment. RESULTS: Eleven procedures in 10 patients were performed. Age 49-75, mean 59 years. Median rest life time was 36 days (11-140). Significant reduction of analgesics was observed 1 week after the procedure, and most patients also reported reduction of pain. No serious side effects were observed. CONCLUSIONS: CT guided neurolytic celiac plexus blockade is a safe and effective treatment for intractable pain caused by advanced pancreatic cancer. Not all patients experience a significant effect, but the side effects are minor, and the procedure should therefore be offered patients experiencing intractable cancer related pain.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND & AIMS: Of patients with new-onset diabetes (NOD; based on glycemic status) older than 50 years, approximately 1% are diagnosed with pancreatic cancer (PC) within 3 years. We aimed to develop and validate a model to determine risk of PC in patients with NOD. METHODS: We retrospectively collected data from 4 independent and nonoverlapping cohorts of patients (N = 1,561) with NOD (based on glycemic status; data collected at date of diagnosis and 12 months previously) in the Rochester Epidemiology Project from January 1, 2000 through December 31, 2015 to create our model. The model weighed scores for 3 factors identified in the discovery cohort to be most strongly associated with PC (64 patients with PC and 192 with type 2 diabetes): change in weight, change in blood glucose, and age at onset of diabetes. We called our model Enriching New-Onset Diabetes for Pancreatic Cancer (ENDPAC). We validated the locked-down model and cutoff score in an independent population-based cohort of 1,096 patients with diabetes; of these, 9 patients (82%) had PC within 3 years of meeting the criteria for NOD. RESULTS: In the discovery cohort, the END-PAC model identified patients who developed PC within 3 years of diabetes onset (area under receiver operating characteristic curve 0.87); a score of at least 3 identified patients who developed PC with 80% sensitivity and specificity. In the validation cohort, a score of at least 3 identified 7 of 9 patients with PC (78%) with 85% specificity; the prevalence of PC in patients with a score of at least 3 (3.6%) was 4.4-fold greater than in patients with NOD. A high END-PAC score in patients who did not have PC (false positives) was often due to such factors as recent steroid use or different malignancy. An ENDPAC score no higher than 0 (in 49% of patients) meant that patients had an extremely low risk for PC. An END-PAC score of at least 3 identified 75% of patients in the discovery cohort more than 6 months before a diagnosis of PC. CONCLUSIONS: Based on change in weight, change in blood glucose, and age at onset of diabetes, we developed and validated a model to determine risk of PC in patients with NOD based on glycemic status (END-PAC model). An independent prospective study is needed to further validate this model, which could contribute to early detection of PC.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Malnutrition and weight loss are commonly observed in patients with pancreatic cancer and contribute to poor survival. Pancreatic exocrine insufficiency (PEI), which can be caused by ductal obstruction by a tumor, causes maldigestion and malabsorption of nutrients, thus contributing to malnutrition in these patients. In this study, we evaluated the effects of pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) on survival in patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on a database of patients with unresectable, pathologically confirmed pancreatic cancer. All patients were evaluated for palliative chemotherapy and received the optimal palliative care. Patients were divided into two groups: Group 1 received standard therapy; Group 2 underwent additional evaluation of the pancreatic function and therapy with PERT, if needed. Survival (median and 95% confidence interval [CI]) was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression; groups were compared using the log-rank test. RESULTS: Overall, 160 patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer were included in the analysis (mean age: 70.5 years [range 28-100]; gender: 57.5% male; tumor stage: 78.7% Stage IV). Eighty-six patients (53.75%) were in Group 1 and 74 (46.25%) were in Group 2. Age, gender, tumor size, location and stage, weight loss, and serum CA 19-9 were similar between groups. Ninety-three (58.1%) patients received palliative chemotherapy; 46.5% in Group 1 and 71.6% in Group 2 (P < 0.001). Forty-nine (66.2%) patients in Group 2 and none in Group 1 received PERT. Survival in Group 2 (189 days, 95% CI 167.0-211.0 days) was significantly longer than in Group 1 (95.0 days, 95% CI 75.4-114.6 days) (HR 2.117, 95% CI 1.493-3.002; P < 0.001). Chemotherapy and PERT were significantly and independently associated with longer survival in a model controlled by age and tumor stage. In patients with significant weight loss at diagnosis (> 10% bodyweight within 6 months), PERT was associated with longer survival (HR 2.52, 95% CI 1.55-4.11; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer, PERT in patients with PEI was associated with longer survival compared with those not receiving PERT, especially in those experiencing significant weight loss. This finding should guide future prospective clinical trials of similar interventions.',\n",

The purpose of the workshop was to explore the relationship and possible mechanisms of the increased risk of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) related to diabetes, the role of altered intracellular energy metabolism in PDAC, the mechanisms and biomarkers of diabetes caused by PDAC, the mechanisms of the increased risk of PDAC associated with obesity, and the role of inflammatory events and mediators as contributing causes of the development of PDAC. Workshop faculty reviewed the state of the current knowledge in these areas and made recommendations for future research efforts. Further knowledge is needed to elucidate the basic mechanisms contributing to the role of hyperinsulinemia, hyperglycemia, adipokines, and acute and chronic inflammatory events on the development of PDAC.',\n",

Notably, skeletal muscle atrophy is a consistent feature affecting the quality of life and prognosis. To date, limited therapeutic options are available, and research in the field is hampered by the lack of satisfactory models to study the complexity of wasting in cachexia-inducing tumors, such as pancreatic cancer. Moreover, currently used in vivo models are characterized by an explosive cachexia with a lethal wasting within few days, while pancreatic cancer patients might experience alterations long before the onset of overt wasting. In this work, we established and characterized a slow-paced model of pancreatic cancer-induced muscle wasting that promotes efficient muscular wasting in vitro and in vivo. Treatment with conditioned media from pancreatic cancer cells led to the induction of atrophy in vitro, while tumor-bearing mice presented a clear reduction in muscle mass and functionality. Intriguingly, several metabolic alterations in tumor-bearing mice were identified, paving the way for therapeutic interventions with drugs targeting metabolism.',\n",

       "  'AB': \"The impact of body mass index (BMI) on postoperative survival in Japanese patients with pancreatic cancer is unclear. We examined the relationship between preoperative BMI and the prognosis of Japanese patients who underwent surgery for pancreatic cancer to determine whether BMI affects these patients' prognosis. Of the patients who underwent pancreatectomy between January 2004 and August 2015 at our institution, 246 were pathologically diagnosed with pancreatic tubular adenocarcinoma; the cancer was located in the pancreatic head (n=161) and in the body and tail (n=85). We classified the patients by BMI: underweight (n=22), normal weight (n=190), and overweight/obese (n=34) groups. We retrospectively analyzed medical records for patient characteristics, lesion location, disease stage, postoperative complications, chemotherapy, and prognosis. Lesion location, disease stage, postoperative complications, and chemotherapy were not significantly different among the BMI groups. The median survival times were as follows (days): all patients, 686; underweight, 485; normal weight, 694; and overweight/obese, 839. In a multivariate analysis, after adjusting for competing risk factors, low BMI was associated with an increased risk of death (normal weight: HR 0.58, p=0.038; overweight/obese: HR 0.54, p=0.059). High BMI was not found to be a postoperative factor for poor prognosis in Japanese pancreatic cancer patients.\",\n",

       "  'AB': \"BACKGROUND AND AIM OF THE WORK: Cancer-related fatigue (CRF) is one of the most common symptoms experienced by cancer patients (CPs) and negatively affects quality of life. Although CRF is frequently experienced, it is often underreported, underdiagnosed and undertreated. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the level of fatigue in patients with pancreatic cancer undergoing chemotherapy and to analyse its correlation with patients' demographic and clinical variables. METHODS: A cross-sectional observational study was implemented in the Oncology Day Hospital of a Northern Italian hospital. A sample of 48 patients receiving chemotherapy were evaluated through the Brief Fatigue Inventory Italian version (BFI-I) between 1 May and 12 October 2016. Data were statistically analysed. RESULTS: Most of our patients (94%) experienced fatigue. Women as well as patients with an age >/=65 years reported more fatigue. Anemia, pain and a weight loss of over 16 kg in the last 6 months were significantly related to the perception of fatigue. Regarding life habits, smoking was related to high global score of BFI-I. CONCLUSIONS: In accordance with literature, our study suggests that fatigue is a frequent symptom influenced by many constitutional, clinical and environmental factors. Our results highlight the need for an early and regular evaluation of fatigue among cancer patients, in order to implement all those pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions with proven efficacy in attenuating this symptom.\",\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Cancer cachexia is a cancer-induced metabolic disorder and a major cause of cancer-induced death. The constituents of cancer cachexia include an increase in energy expenditure, hepatic gluconeogenesis, fat lipolysis, and skeletal-muscle proteolysis and a decrease in body weight. The aetiology of cancer cachexia is unclear and may involve cancer-cell metabolism and secretion. In this study, we investigated whether the high glycolysis in cancer cells (the Warburg effect) triggers cachexia in athymic mice carrying pancreatic cancer cells. METHODS: First, we examined five human pancreatic cancer cell lines for glycolysis and cachectic-cytokine secretion. Consequently, MiaPaCa2 and AsPC1 cells were selected for the present study, because the glycolysis in MiaPaCa2 cells was typically high and that in AsPC1 cells was exceptionally low. In addition, both MiaPaCa2 and AsPC1 cells were competent in the secretion of examined cytokines. Next, we transplanted MiaPaCa2 and AsPC1 cells subcutaneously in different athymic mice for 8 weeks, using intact athymic mice for control. In another experiment, we treated normal mice with the supernatants of MiaPaCa2 or AsPC1 cells for 7 days, using vehicle-treated mice for control. In both models, we measured food intake and body weight, assayed plasma glucose, triglycerides, and TNF-alpha and used Western blot to determine the proteins that regulated hepatic gluconeogenesis, fat lipolysis, and skeletal-muscle proteolysis in the corresponding tissues. We also studied the effect of MiaPaCa2-cell supernatants on the proteolysis of C2C12 skeletal-muscle cells in vitro. RESULTS: The athymic mice carrying high-glycolytic MiaPaCa2 cells had anorexia and also showed evidence for cachexia, including increased hepatic gluconeogenesis, fat lipolysis and skeletal-muscle proteolysis and decreased body weight. The athymic mice carrying low-glycolytic AsPC1 cells had anorexia but did not show the above-mentioned evidence for cachexia. When normal mice were treated with the supernatants of MiaPaCa2 or AsPC1 cells, their energy homeostasis was largely normal. Thus, the cachexia in the athymic mice carrying MiaPaCa2 cells may not result from humeral factors released by the cancer cells. In vitro, MiaPaCa2-cell supernatants did not induce proteolysis in C2C12 cells. CONCLUSION: The Warburg effect in pancreatic cancer cells is an independent aetiological factor for pancreatic cancer-induced cachexia.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. The poor prognosis of this disease highlights the urgent need to develop more effective therapies. Activation of the STAT3 represents a potential drug target for pancreatic cancer therapy. Currently, clinically available small-molecule inhibitors targeting STAT3 are lacking. METHODS: Through bioassay screening and molecular docking, we identified a small molecule L61H46 that can potently target constitutive STAT3 signaling and kill human pancreatic cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS: L61H46 effectively reduced colony formation and the viability of pancreatic cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner with half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) values in the range between 0.86 and 2.83 microM. L61H46 significantly inhibited STAT3 phosphorylation (Tyr705) and the subsequent nucleus translocation but did not downregulate STAT1 phosphorylation. Moreover, L61H46 demonstrated a potent activity in suppressing pancreatic tumor growth in BXPC-3 xenograft model in vivo. Furthermore, L61H46 showed no signs of adverse effects on liver, heart, and kidney cells in vivo. CONCLUSION: Collectively, our results suggest that L61H46 could be further optimized into a highly potent STAT3 inhibitor for the treatment of pancreatic cancer.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Studies on EUS-guided transmural biliary drainage (EUS-BD) have evaluated its efficacy as a rescue technique after failed ERCP. We performed a single-center, single-blind, randomized trial to compare EUS-BD and ERCP as primary treatment for distal biliary obstruction in pancreatic cancer. METHODS: Patients underwent EUS-BD (n = 33) or ERCP (n = 34). The primary endpoint was the rate of adverse events. Secondary endpoints were technical success, treatment success (defined as decline in serum bilirubin by 50% at a 2-week follow-up), reinterventions, and intraoperative technical outcome, when applicable. Follow-up was until death or a minimum of 6 months. RESULTS: The rates of adverse events were 21.2% (6.1% moderate severity; others mild severity) in the EUS-BD group and 14.7% (5.9% moderate severity; others mild severity) in the ERCP group (risk ratio, .69; 95% confidence interval, .24-1.97; P = .49). There were no procedure-related deaths. There was no significant difference in the rates of technical success (90.9% vs 94.1%, P = .67), treatment success (97% vs 91.2%, P = .61), or reinterventions (3.0% vs 2.9%, P = .99) between EUS-BD and ERCP cohorts, respectively. The endoscopic interventions did not impede subsequent pancreaticoduodenectomy that was performed in 5 of 33 patients (15.2%) in the EUS-BD and 5 of 34 patients (14.7%) in the ERCP group (P = .99). CONCLUSIONS: Given the similar rates of adverse events and treatment outcomes in this randomized trial, EUS-BD is a practical alternative to ERCP for primary biliary decompression in pancreatic cancer.

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Controversy remains about the best pre-operative management of jaundice in patients with resectable pancreatic head cancer (RPC) undergoing planned pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD). OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare rates of post-operative complications in patients undergoing four pre-operative approaches (POA): preoperative biliary drainage with plastic stent (PBD-PS), metal stent (PBD-MS), and percutaneous transhepatic drain (PBD-PT), or no pre-operative biliary drainage (NPBD). METHOD: A study was included in the systematic review if it assessed the effects of PBD on post-operative outcomes in jaundiced patients with RPC. Endpoints were the rate of any post-operative complication, wound infection, intra-abdominal infection and post-operative bleeding. A network meta-analysis (NMA) was performed to rank the POAs from the best to worst, for each outcome. RESULTS: Thirty-two studies were included in the systematic review. Ten out of 32 studies included in the systematic review reported at least one of the 4 outcomes of interest and thus were used for NMA. The calculated odds ratios and P-scores ranked NPBD as the best approach. There was insufficient evidence to determine the best modality of PBD among PBD-PS, PBD-MS and PBD-PT. CONCLUSIONS: No preoperative biliary drainage may be the best management of preoperative jaundice in patients with RPC before PD. Further studies are needed to determine the best modality in patients that need PBD.',\n",

For early diagnosis of PC, patients with clinical manifestations suggestive of PC and high risk for developing PC need to be selected for examinations for PC. Signs suggestive of PC (e.g., symptoms, diabetes mellitus, acute pancreatitis, or abnormal results of blood examinations) should not be missed, and the details of risks for PC (e.g., familial history of PC, intraductal mucin producing neoplasm, chronic pancreatitis, hereditary pancreatitis, or life habit) should be understood. Multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be performed for diagnosing PC, but the diagnostic ability of these examinations for PC is limited. Endoscopic diagnostic procedures, such as endoscopic ultrasonography, including fine-needle aspiration, and endoscopic retrograde pancreatocholangiography, including Serial Pancreatic-juice Aspiration Cytologic Examination (SPACE), could be recommended for a detailed examination to diagnose pancreatic carcinoma earlier.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Sarcopenia and post-operative accelerated muscle loss leading to cachexia are commonly observed in patients with pancreatic cancer. This study aimed to assess the influence of body compositions and post-operative muscle change on survival of patients with surgically treated pancreatic cancer. METHODS: We analysed data of patients diagnosed with pancreatic adenocarcinoma who underwent surgery from 2008 to 2015. Skeletal muscle areas, muscle attenuation, and visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue areas were measured from two sets of computed tomography images at L3 vertebral levels. In addition, muscle change was calculated from images obtained before and after cancer resection. We set our own cut-off values of various body compositions based on sex-specific tertiles. RESULTS: A total of 180 patients were analysed. Patients with perioperative sarcopenia (n = 60) showed poorer overall survival than those without perioperative sarcopenia (P = 0.031). Fifty (28.6%) patients with accelerated muscle loss after surgery (>10%/60 days) had poorer survival compared with the others (P = 0.029). Sarcopenia (hazard ratio, 1.79: 95% confidence interval, 1.20-2.65] and post-operative muscle change (%/60 days) (hazard ratio, 0.94: 95% confidence interval, 0.92-0.96) were identified as significant predictors of survival on multivariable analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative sarcopenia identified on CT scan was associated with poor overall survival in patients with pancreatic cancer following surgery. Accelerated muscle loss after surgery also negatively impacted survival in pancreatic cancer patients.',\n",

In this article, we aim to review the literature regarding weight loss on prevention of pancreatic cancer. Epidemiological and laboratory studies have shown that obesity is associated with increased incidence of pancreatic cancer and potentially worse cancer outcome. Whereas the underlying pathomechanisms remain unclear, chronic inflammation, insulin resistance, and altered intestinal microbiota are all implicated in the carcinogenic effect of obesity. Weight loss, especially the durable and significant weight loss after bariatric surgery, has been shown to reduce the risks of multiple cancers and may become a good intervention for pancreatic cancer prevention.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Cancer-associated wasting, termed cancer cachexia, has a profound effect on the morbidity and mortality of cancer patients but remains difficult to recognize and diagnose. While increases in circulating levels of a number of inflammatory cytokines have been associated with cancer cachexia, these associations were generally made in patients with advanced disease and thus may be associated with disease progression rather than directly with the cachexia syndrome. Thus, we sought to assess potential biomarkers of cancer-induced cachexia in patients with earlier stages of disease. METHODS: A custom multiplex array was used to measure circulating levels of 25 soluble factors from 70 pancreatic cancer patients undergoing attempted tumour resections. A high-sensitivity multiplex was used for increased sensitivity for nine cytokines. RESULTS: Resectable pancreatic cancer patients with cachexia had low levels of canonical pro-inflammatory cytokines including interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), and tumour necrosis factor (TNF). Even in our more sensitive analysis, these cytokines were not associated with cancer cachexia. Of the 25 circulating factors tested, only monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) was increased in treatment-naive cachectic patients compared with weight stable patients and identified as a potential biomarker for cancer cachexia. Although circulating levels of leptin and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) were found to be decreased in the same cohort of treatment-naive cachectic patients, these factors were closely associated with body mass index, limiting their utility as cancer cachexia biomarkers. CONCLUSIONS: Unlike in advanced disease, it is possible that cachexia in patients with resectable pancreatic cancer is not associated with high levels of classical markers of systemic inflammation. However, cachectic, treatment-naive patients have higher levels of MCP-1, suggesting that MCP-1 may be useful as a biomarker of cancer cachexia.',\n",

       "  'AB': \"RATIONALE: Heterotaxy with polysplenia is an extremely rare congenital condition resulting from abnormal arrangement of organs in the abdominal and thoracic cavities during embryologic development. When a malignancy such as pancreatic cancer develops under these conditions, surgical resection becomes particularly complex. This case report demonstrates successful pancreatic cancer resection despite the patient's complicated anatomy. PATIENT CONCERNS: An 82-year-old female presented to our institution with complaints of mild right upper quadrant pain radiating to the mid-epigastric region. DIAGNOSES: Physical examination revealed jaundice with scleral icterus consistent with obstructive jaundice. Radiographic imaging revealed hepatic duct dilation with several anatomic anomalies including small bowel location in the right upper abdomen, cecum, and appendix in the left lower quadrant, reversed superior mesenteric artery and superior mesenteric vein positions, and right-sided duodenal-jejunal flexture as well as an entirely right-sided pancreas, and left lower pelvis with >/=6 separate splenules. These findings resulted in a diagnosis of heterotaxy syndrome with polysplenia. INTERVENTIONS: Careful preoperative planning and total pancreatectomy was performed without complication. OUTCOMES: The patient recovered well. Pathologic examination of the pancreatic mass revealed moderately/poorly differentiated invasive pancreatic duct adenocarcinoma. The patient remains alive and well without signs of recurrent disease at the 2-year follow-up. LESSONS: Given the wide range of anatomical variants observed in patients with heterotaxy syndrome, a thorough radiologic assessment is necessary before engaging in any surgical procedure. In our case, preoperative identification of the various anatomic anomalies, such as the short and vertically oriented pancreas, the porta hepatis position anterior to the duodenum, the nonrotation of the intestines and the anomalous origin of the right hepatic artery allowed us to perform a safe and uncomplicated total pancreatectomy.\",\n",

       "  'AB': \"BACKGROUND: The changes in body composition that occur in response to therapy for localized pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and during the early survivorship period, as well as their clinical significance, are poorly understood. METHODS: One hundred twenty-seven consecutive patients with PDAC who received preoperative therapy followed by pancreatoduodenectomy (PD) at a single institution between 2009 and 2012 were longitudinally evaluated. Changes in skeletal muscle (SKM), visceral adipose tissue (VAT), and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) were measured on serial computed tomography images obtained upon presentation, prior to pancreatectomy, and approximately 3 and 12 months after surgery. RESULTS: Prior to therapy, patients' mean baseline BMI was 26.5 +/- 4.7 kg/m(2) and 63.0% met radiographic criteria for sarcopenia. During a mean 5.4 +/- 2.3 months of preoperative therapy, minimal changes in SKM (- 0.5 +/- 7.8%, p > 0.05), VAT (- 1.8 +/- 62.6%, p < 0.001), and SAT (- 4.8 +/- 27.7%, p < 0.001) were observed. In contrast, clinically significant changes were observed on postoperative CT compared to baseline anthropometry: SKM - 4.1 +/- 10.7%, VAT - 38.7 +/- 30.2%, and SAT - 24.1 +/- 22.6% (all p < 0.001) and these changes persisted at one year following PD. While anthropometric changes during preoperative therapy were not independently associated with survival, SKM gain between the postoperative period and one-year follow-up was associated with improved overall survival (OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.29-0.87). CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to the minor changes that occur during preoperative therapy for PDAC, significant losses in key anthropometric parameters tend to occur over the first year following PD. Ongoing SKM loss in the postoperative period may represent an early marker for worse outcomes.\",\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: A high body mass index (BMI) has been proposed as an important risk factor for pancreatic cancer. However, this association of BMI with pancreatic cancer risk has not been confirmed in Asian populations. METHODS: We evaluated the association between BMI (either at baseline or during early adulthood) and pancreatic cancer risk by conducting a pooled analysis of nine population-based prospective cohort studies in Japan with more than 340,000 subjects. Summary hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated by pooling study-specific HRs for unified BMI categories with a random-effects model. RESULTS: Among Japanese men, being obese at baseline was associated with a higher risk of pancreatic cancer incidence (>/=30 kg/m(2) compared with 23 to <25 kg/m(2), adjusted HR 1.71; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03-2.86). A J-shaped association between BMI during early adulthood and pancreatic cancer incidence was seen in men. In contrast, we observed no clear association among women, although there may be a positive linear association between BMI at baseline and the risk of pancreatic cancer (per 1 kg/m(2), adjusted HR 1.02; 95% CI, 1.00-1.05). CONCLUSIONS: Pooling of data from cohort studies with a considerable number of Japanese subjects revealed a significant positive association between obesity and pancreatic cancer risk among men. This information indicates that strategies that effectively prevent obesity among men might lead to a reduced burden of pancreatic cancer, especially in Asian populations.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) continues to be a lethal disease with no efficacious treatment modalities. The incidence of PDAC is expected to increase, at least partially because of the obesity epidemic. Increased efforts to prevent or intercept this disease are clearly needed. Mutations in KRAS are initiating events in pancreatic carcinogenesis supported by genetically engineered mouse models of the disease. However, oncogenic KRAS is not entirely sufficient for the development of fully invasive PDAC. Additional genetic mutations and/or environmental, nutritional, and metabolic stressors, e.g. inflammation and obesity, are required for efficient PDAC formation with activation of KRAS downstream effectors. Multiple factors \"upstream\" of KRAS associated with obesity, including insulin resistance, inflammation, changes in gut microbiota and GI peptides, can enhance/modulate downstream signals. Multiple signaling networks and feedback loops \"downstream\" of KRAS have been described that respond to obesogenic diets. We propose that KRAS mutations potentiate a signaling network that is promoted by environmental factors. Specifically, we envisage that KRAS mutations increase the intensity and duration of the growth-promoting signaling network. As the transcriptional activator YAP plays a critical role in the network, we conclude that the rationale for targeting the network (at different points), e.g. with FDA approved drugs such as statins and metformin, is therefore compelling.',\n",

AIM: To assess the early morbidity and mortality of patients with pancreatic cancer who underwent cholecystojejunal derivation, and to assess the success of this procedure in relieving jaundice. METHOD: This retrospective study examined the medical records of patients who underwent surgery. They were categorized into early death and non-early death groups according to case outcome. RESULTS: 51.8% of the patients were male and 48.2% were female. The mean age was 62.3 years. Early mortality was 14.5%, and 10.9% of them experienced surgical complications. The cholecystojejunostomy procedure was effective in 97% of cases. There was a tendency of increased survival in women and patients with preoperative serum total bilirubin levels below 15 mg/dl. CONCLUSION: Cholecystojejunal derivation is a good therapeutic option for relieving jaundice in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer, with acceptable rates of morbidity and mortality.',\n",

       "  'AB': \"AIM: To evaluate the association of body mass index (BMI) with the overall survival of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of PDAC patients diagnosed in the National Cancer Center of China between January 1999 and December 2014 was performed. These patients were categorized into four BMI groups (< 18.5, 18.5-22.9, 23-27.4 and >/= 27.5 kg/m(2)). chi(2) tests for comparison of the proportions of categorical variables, and Student's t-test or Mann-Whitney test for continuous variables were employed. Survival analysis was performed with the Kaplan-Meyer method. Their HRs of mortality and 95%CIs were estimated using the Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS: With a median age of 59.6 years (range: 22.5-84.6 years), in total 1783 PDAC patients were enrolled in this study. Their mean usual BMI was 24.19 +/- 3.53 for the whole cohort. More than half of the patients (59.3%) experienced weight loss during the disease onset and progression. Compared with healthy-weight individuals, newly diagnosed patients who were overweight or obese had more severe weight loss during their disease onset and progression (P < 0.001). Individuals who were overweight or obese were associated with positive smoking history (P < 0.001). A significant difference in comorbidity of diabetes (P = 0.044) and coronary artery disease (P < 0.001) was identified between high BMI and normal-weight patients. After a median follow-up of 8 mo, the survival analysis showed no association between BMI and the overall survival (P = 0.90, n = 1783). When we stratified the whole cohort by pancreatic cancer stage, no statistically significant association between BMI and overall survival was found for resectable (P = 0.99, n = 217), unresectable locally advanced (P = 0.90, n = 316) and metastatic patients (P = 0.88, n = 1250), respectively. The results did not change when we used the BMI at diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Our results showed no significance of BMI for the overall survival of PDAC patients.\",\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Risk factors for pancreatic cancer include a cluster of metabolic conditions such as obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes. Given that these risk factors are correlated, separating out causal from confounded effects is challenging. Mendelian randomization (MR), or the use of genetic instrumental variables, may facilitate the identification of the metabolic drivers of pancreatic cancer. METHODS: We identified genetic instruments for obesity, body shape, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes in order to evaluate their causal role in pancreatic cancer etiology. These instruments were analyzed in relation to risk using a likelihood-based MR approach within a series of 7110 pancreatic cancer patients and 7264 control subjects using genome-wide data from the Pancreatic Cancer Cohort Consortium (PanScan) and the Pancreatic Cancer Case-Control Consortium (PanC4). Potential unknown pleiotropic effects were assessed using a weighted median approach and MR-Egger sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Results indicated a robust causal association of increasing body mass index (BMI) with pancreatic cancer risk (odds ratio [OR] = 1.34, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.09 to 1.65, for each standard deviation increase in BMI [4.6 kg/m2]). There was also evidence that genetically increased fasting insulin levels were causally associated with an increased risk of pancreatic cancer (OR = 1.66, 95% CI = 1.05 to 2.63, per SD [44.4 pmol/L]). Notably, no evidence of a causal relationship was observed for type 2 diabetes, nor for dyslipidemia. Sensitivity analyses did not indicate that pleiotropy was an important source of bias. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest a causal role of BMI and fasting insulin in pancreatic cancer etiology.',\n",

Among DSC patients except pancreatic cancer, the overall HR for the highest versus the lowest BMI category was 0.82 (95% CI = 0.71-0.92). Additionally, comparing the highest and lowest BMI categories, the combined HR of pancreatic cancer was 1.22 (95% CI = 1.01-1.43). Our meta-analysis suggested an increased OS among adult overweight and obese DSC survivors except pancreatic cancer. Overweight and obesity in adulthood may be important prognostic factors that indicate an increased survival from DSC patients except pancreatic cancer.',\n",

       "  'AB': \"BACKGROUND: Observational studies suggest that diet may influence pancreatic cancer risk. We investigated the effect of a low-fat dietary intervention on pancreatic cancer incidence. METHODS: The Women's Health Initiative Dietary Modification (WHI-DM) trial is a randomized controlled trial conducted in 48 835 postmenopausal women age 50 to 79 years in the United States between 1993 and 1998. Women were randomly assigned to the intervention group (n = 19 541), with the goal of reducing total fat intake and increasing intake of vegetables, fruits, and grains, or to the usual diet comparison group (n = 29 294). The intervention concluded in March 2005. We evaluated the effect of the intervention on pancreatic cancer incidence with the follow-up through 2014 using the log-rank test and multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression model. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: In intention-to-treat analyses including 46 200 women, 92 vs 165 pancreatic cancer cases were ascertained in the intervention vs the comparison group (P = .23). The multivariable hazard ratio (HR) of pancreatic cancer was 0.86 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.67 to 1.11). Risk was statistically significantly reduced among women with baseline body mass indexes (BMIs) of 25 kg/m2 or higher (HR = 0.71, 95% CI = 0.53 to 0.96), but not among women with BMIs of less than 25 kg/m2 (HR = 1.62, 95% CI = 0.97 to 2.71, Pinteraction = .01). CONCLUSIONS: A low-fat dietary intervention was associated with reduced pancreatic cancer incidence in women who were overweight or obese in the WHI-DM trial. Caution needs to be taken in interpreting the findings based on subgroup analyses.\",\n",

       "  'AB': 'Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is among the deadliest types of cancer. The worldwide estimates of its incidence and mortality in the general population are eight cases per 100,000 person-years and seven deaths per 100,000 person-years, and they are significantly higher in the United States than in the rest of the world. The incidence of this disease in the United States is more than 50,000 new cases in 2017. Indeed, total deaths due to PDAC are projected to increase dramatically to become the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths before 2030. Considering the failure to date to efficiently treat existing PDAC, increased effort should be undertaken to prevent this disease. A better understanding of the risk factors leading to PDAC development is of utmost importance to identify and formulate preventive strategies. Large epidemiologic and cohort studies have identified risk factors for the development of PDAC, including obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus. This review highlights the current knowledge of obesity and type 2 diabetes as risk factors for PDAC development and progression, their interplay and underlying mechanisms, and the relation to diet. Research gaps and opportunities to address this deadly disease are also outlined.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'OBJECTIVES: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is often accompanied by weight loss. We sought to characterize factors associated with weight loss and observed nutritional interventions, as well as define the effect of weight loss on survival. METHODS: Consecutive subjects diagnosed with PDAC (N = 123) were retrospectively evaluated. Univariate analysis was used to compare subjects with and without substantial (>5%) weight loss. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to identify factors associated with weight loss, and survival analyses were performed using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox survival models. RESULTS: Substantial weight loss at diagnosis was present in 71.5% of subjects and was independently associated with higher baseline body mass index, longer symptom duration, and increased tumor size. Recommendations for nutrition consultation and pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy occurred in 27.6% and 36.9% of subjects, respectively. Weight loss (>5%) was not associated with worse survival on multivariate analysis (hazard ratio, 1.32; 95% confidence interval, 0.76-2.30), unless a higher threshold (>10%) was used (hazard ratio, 1.77; 95% confidence interval, 1.09-2.87). CONCLUSIONS: Despite the high prevalence of weight loss at PDAC diagnosis, there are low observed rates of nutritional interventions. Weight loss based on current criteria for cancer cachexia is not associated with poor survival in PDAC.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Adult adiposity is positively associated with pancreatic cancer in Western populations. Little is known, however, about the association in China where many have lower body mass index (BMI) or about the relevance of young adulthood adiposity for pancreatic cancer in both Western and East Asian populations. METHODS: The China Kadoorie Biobank (CKB) recruited 512 891 adults aged 30-79 years during 2004-2008, recording 595 incident cases of pancreatic cancer during 8-year follow-up. Cox regression yielded adjusted HRs for pancreatic cancer associated with self-reported young adulthood (mean ~25 years) BMI and with measured adulthood (mean ~52 years) BMI and other adiposity measures (eg, waist circumference (WC)). These were further meta-analysed with published prospective studies. RESULTS: Overall, the mean BMI (SD) was 21.9 (2.6) at age 25 years and 23.7 (3.3) kg/m(2) at age 52 years. Young adulthood BMI was strongly positively associated with pancreatic cancer in CKB (adjusted HR=1.36, 95% CI 1.16 to 1.61, per 5 kg/m(2) higher BMI) and in meta-analysis of CKB and four other studies (1.18, 1.12 to 1.24). In CKB, there was also a positive association of pancreatic cancer with adulthood BMI (1.11, 0.97 to 1.27, per 5 kg/m(2)), similar in magnitude to that in meta-analyses of East Asian studies using measured BMI (n=2; 1.08, 0.99 to 1.19) and of Western studies (n=25; 1.10, 1.06 to 1.12). Likewise, meta-analysis of four studies, including CKB, showed a positive association of adulthood WC with pancreatic cancer (1.10, 1.06 to 1.14, per 10 cm). CONCLUSIONS: In both East Asian and Western populations, adiposity was positively associated with risk of pancreatic cancer, with a somewhat stronger association for young than late-life adiposity.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Epidemiologic data has linked obesity to a higher risk of pancreatic cancer, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. To allow for detailed mechanistic studies in a relevant model mimicking diet-induced obesity and pancreatic cancer, a high-fat, high-calorie diet (HFCD) was given to P48+/Cre;LSL-KRASG12D (KC) mice carrying a pancreas-specific oncogenic Kras mutation. The mice were randomly allocated to a HFCD or control diet (CD). Cohorts were sacrificed at 3, 6, and 9 months and tissues were harvested for further analysis. Compared to CD-fed mice, HFCD-fed animals gained significantly more weight. Importantly, the cancer incidence was remarkably increased in HFCD-fed KC mice, particularly in male KC mice. In addition, KC mice fed the HFCD showed more extensive inflammation and fibrosis, and more advanced PanIN lesions in the pancreas, compared to age-matched CD-fed animals. Interestingly, we found that the HFCD reduced autophagic flux in PanIN lesions in KC mice. Further, exome sequencing of isolated murine PanIN lesions identified numerous genetic variants unique to the HFCD. These data underscore the role of sustained inflammation and dysregulated autophagy in diet-induced pancreatic cancer development and suggest that diet-induced genetic alterations may contribute to this process. Our findings provide a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the obesity-cancer link in males and females, and will facilitate the development of interventions targeting obesity-associated pancreatic cancer.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Obesity is an established risk factor for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA). Despite recent identification of metabolic alterations in this lethal malignancy, the metabolic dependencies of obesity-associated PDA remain unknown. Here we show that obesity-driven PDA exhibits accelerated growth and a striking transcriptional enrichment for pathways regulating nitrogen metabolism. We find that the mitochondrial form of arginase (ARG2), which hydrolyzes arginine into ornithine and urea, is induced upon obesity, and silencing or loss of ARG2 markedly suppresses PDA. In vivo infusion of (15)N-glutamine in obese mouse models of PDA demonstrates enhanced nitrogen flux into the urea cycle and infusion of (15)N-arginine shows that Arg2 loss causes significant ammonia accumulation that results from the shunting of arginine catabolism into alternative nitrogen repositories. Furthermore, analysis of PDA patient tumors indicates that ARG2 levels correlate with body mass index (BMI). The specific dependency of PDA on ARG2 rather than the principal hepatic enzyme ARG1 opens a therapeutic window for obesity-associated pancreatic cancer.Obesity is an established risk factor for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA). Here the authors show that obesity induces the expression of the mitochondrial form of arginase ARG2 in PDA and that ARG2 silencing or loss results in ammonia accumulation and suppression of obesity-driven PDA tumor growth.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Pancreatic tumors are renowned for their extremely hypoxic centers, resulting in upregulation of a number of hypoxia mediated signaling pathways including cell proliferation, metabolism and cell survival. Previous studies from our laboratory have shown that Minnelide, a water-soluble pro-drug of triptolide (anti-cancer compound), decreases viability of cancer cells in vitro as well as in vivo. However, its mechanism of action remain elusive. In the current study we evaluated the effect of Minnelide, on hypoxia mediated oncogenic signaling as well as stemness in pancreatic cancer. Minnelide has just completed Phase 1 trial against GI cancers and is currently awaiting Phase 2 trials. Our results showed that upon treatment with triptolide, HIF-1alpha protein accumulated in pancreatic cancer cells even though hypoxic response was decreased in them. Our studies showed even though HIF-1alpha is accumulated in the treated cells, there was no decrease in HIF-1 binding to hypoxia response elements. However, the HIF-1 transcriptional activity was significantly reduced owing to depletion of co-activator p300 upon treatment with triptolide. Further, treatment with triptolide resulted in a decreased activity of Sp1 and NF-kB the two major oncogenic signaling pathway in pancreatic cancer along with a decreased tumor initiating cell (TIC) population in pancreatic tumor.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'There is emerging evidence on the mechanisms of pancreatic cancer pain. Following the establishment of an orthotropic transplantation model of pancreatic cancer, microarray analysis was performed to identify changes in the expression levels of pain‑associated genes in the spinal cord. A mouse model of pancreatic cancer‑induced pain was established by implanting SW 1990 cells into the pancreases of female BALB/c‑nu mice. The survival rate and body weight were measured following orthotropic transplantation. Gross anatomical techniques and hematoxylin and eosin staining were used to analyze the pancreatic tumor tissue. Multiple behavioral tests were also performed to assess pain‑associated responses. Additionally, using samples from mice with or without observable pain, microarray analysis was performed to determine the gene expression profiles in the spinal cord dorsal horn. The survival rate of mice with pancreatic cancer was high during the initial 3 weeks post‑surgery, although the body weight decreased progressively. Gross anatomical techniques demonstrated that the tumor size increased significantly following the surgery, and this result was confirmed by solid tumor masses in the pancreatic tissues of the mouse model. Observable pain behavioral responses were also examined in the pancreatic cancer model by measuring the mechanical threshold of the abdominal skin, hunching behavior and visceromotor responses. The profiles of 10 pain specific‑associated genes in the spinal cord dorsal horn that accurately reflect the molecular pathological progression of disease were also identified. In conclusion, the present study has developed a novel animal model of pancreatic cancer pain in BALB/c‑nu mice that resembles human pancreatic cancer pain, and the expression of pain‑associated genes in the spinal cord dorsal horn has been profiled. The results of the present study may further the understanding of the molecular mechanisms that mediate pancreatic cancer pain.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Cachexia is a complex metabolic and behavioural syndrome lacking effective therapies. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most important conditions associated with cachexia, with >80% of PDAC patients suffering from the condition. To establish the cardinal features of a murine model of PDAC-associated cachexia, we characterized the effects of implanting a pancreatic tumour cell line from a syngeneic C57BL/6 KRAS(G12D) P53(R172H) Pdx-Cre(+/+) (KPC) mouse. METHODS: Male and female C57BL/6 mice were inoculated subcutaneously, intraperitoneally, or orthotopically with KPC tumour cells. We performed rigorous phenotypic, metabolic, and behavioural analysis of animals over the course of tumour development. RESULTS: All routes of administration produced rapidly growing tumours histologically consistent with moderate to poorly differentiated PDAC. The phenotype of this model was dependent on route of administration, with orthotopic and intraperitoneal implantation inducing more severe cachexia than subcutaneous implantation. KPC tumour growth decreased food intake, decreased adiposity and lean body mass, and decreased locomotor activity. Muscle catabolism was observed in both skeletal and cardiac muscles, but the dominant catabolic pathway differed between these tissues. The wasting syndrome in this model was accompanied by hypothalamic inflammation, progressively decreasing brown and white adipose tissue uncoupling protein 1 (Ucp1) expression, and increased peripheral inflammation. Haematological and endocrine abnormalities included neutrophil-dominant leukocytosis and anaemia, and decreased serum testosterone. CONCLUSIONS: Syngeneic KPC allografts are a robust model for studying cachexia, which recapitulate key features of the PDAC disease process and induce a wide array of cachexia manifestations. This model is therefore ideally suited for future studies exploring the physiological systems involved in cachexia and for preclinical studies of novel therapies.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) displays extensive and poorly vascularized desmoplastic stromal reaction, and therefore, pancreatic cancer (PaCa) cells are confronted with nutrient deprivation and hypoxia. Here, we investigate the roles of autophagy and metabolism in PaCa cell adaptation to environmental stresses, amino acid (AA) depletion, and hypoxia. It is known that in healthy cells, basal autophagy is at a low level, but it is greatly activated by environmental stresses. By contrast, we find that in PaCa cells, basal autophagic activity is relatively high, but AA depletion and hypoxia activate autophagy only weakly or not at all, due to their failure to inhibit mechanistic target of rapamycin. Basal, but not stress-induced, autophagy is necessary for PaCa cell proliferation, and AA supply is even more critical to maintain PaCa cell growth. To gain insight into the underlying mechanisms, we analyzed the effects of autophagy inhibition and AA depletion on PaCa cell metabolism. PaCa cells display mixed oxidative/glycolytic metabolism, with oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) predominant. Both autophagy inhibition and AA depletion dramatically decreased OXPHOS; furthermore, pharmacologic inhibitors of OXPHOS suppressed PaCa cell proliferation. The data indicate that the maintenance of OXPHOS is a key mechanism through which autophagy and AA supply support PaCa cell growth. We find that the expression of oncogenic activation mutation in GTPase Kras markedly promotes basal autophagy and stimulates OXPHOS through an autophagy-dependent mechanism. The results suggest that approaches aimed to suppress OXPHOS, particularly through limiting AA supply, could be beneficial in treating PDAC.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Cancer cells in the highly desmoplastic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma confront nutrient [i.e., amino acids (AA)] deprivation and hypoxia, but how pancreatic cancer (PaCa) cells adapt to these conditions is poorly understood. This study provides evidence that the maintenance of mitochondrial function, in particular, oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), is a key mechanism that supports PaCa cell growth, both in normal conditions and under the environmental stresses. OXPHOS in PaCa cells critically depends on autophagy and AA supply. Furthermore, the oncogenic activation mutation in GTPase Kras upregulates OXPHOS through an autophagy-dependent mechanism.',\n",

Since it is usually diagnosed at an advanced stage, its prognosis remains poor. The initial presentation varies according to the tumor location. The most common presenting signs are weight loss, jaundice, and pain. Several epidemiological, clinical, and experimental studies over the past 2 decades have shown that long-standing diabetes is a modest risk factor for pancreatic cancer. However, new-onset diabetes has also been observed to be an early manifestation of pancreatic cancer.

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Cancer cachexia is a syndrome of weight loss (including muscle and fat), anorexia, and decreased physical function. It has been suggested that the optimal treatment for cachexia should be a multimodal intervention. The primary aim of this study was to examine the feasibility and safety of a multimodal intervention (n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid nutritional supplements, exercise, and anti-inflammatory medication: celecoxib) for cancer cachexia in patients with incurable lung or pancreatic cancer, undergoing chemotherapy. METHODS: Patients receiving two cycles of standard chemotherapy were randomized to either the multimodal cachexia intervention or standard care. Primary outcome measures were feasibility assessed by recruitment, attrition, and compliance with intervention (>50% of components in >50% of patients). Key secondary outcomes were change in weight, muscle mass, physical activity, safety, and survival. RESULTS: Three hundred and ninety-nine were screened resulting in 46 patients recruited (11.5%). Twenty five patients were randomized to the treatment and 21 as controls. Forty-one completed the study (attrition rate 11%). Compliance to the individual components of the intervention was 76% for celecoxib, 60% for exercise, and 48% for nutritional supplements. As expected from the sample size, there was no statistically significant effect on physical activity or muscle mass. There were no intervention-related Serious Adverse Events and survival was similar between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: A multimodal cachexia intervention is feasible and safe in patients with incurable lung or pancreatic cancer; however, compliance to nutritional supplements was suboptimal. A phase III study is now underway to assess fully the effect of the intervention.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'OBJECTIVE: Limitations associated with current animal models serve as a major obstacle to reliable preclinical evaluation of therapies in pancreatic cancer (PC). In an effort to develop more reliable preclinical models, we have recently established a subcutaneous patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model. However, critical aspects of PC responsible for its highly lethal nature, such as the development of distant metastasis and cancer cachexia, remain underrepresented in the flank PDX model. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the degree to which an orthotopic PDX model of PC recapitulates these aspects of the human disease. METHODS: Human PDX-derived PC tumors were implanted directly into the pancreas of NOD.Cg-Prkdc Il2rg/SzJ mice. Tumor growth, metastasis, and muscle wasting were then evaluated. RESULTS: Orthotopically implanted PDX-derived tumors consistently incorporated into the murine pancreatic parenchyma, metastasized to both the liver and lungs and induced muscle wasting directly proportional to the size of the tumor, consistent of the cancer cachexia syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: Through the orthotopic implantation technique described, we demonstrate a highly reproducible model that recapitulates both local and systemic aspects of human PC.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Pancreatic cancer is rare but highly malignant. Studies have shown that surgeons\\' knowledge closely links to the correct diagnosis and treatment outcomes of pancreatic cancer. The purpose of this study was to survey current surgeons\\' knowledge regarding pancreatic cancer. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 705 surgeons who attended the 2011 China Surgical Week\\'s meeting in Beijing. A questionnaire regarding the risk factors, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of pancreatic cancer was used. Surgeons\\' answers were analyzed and compared among different regions, levels of hospital, and professional ranks. RESULTS: Most surgeons had a correct knowledge toward the risk factors, diagnosis, and management of pancreatic cancer. However, several knowledge gaps were identified. They include \"The association between type 2 diabetes and pancreatic cancer\", \"The most common histologic type of pancreatic neoplasm\", \"the typical clinical symptoms of pancreatic cancer\", \"The accuracy of ultrasound in screening pancreatic cancer\", \"Enhanced CT in the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer\", and \"Which is more superior between MRI and CT in the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer\". We also found that overall surgeons\\' responses did not depend on their geographic locations, but on hospital levels and professional ranks. Surgeons working at level three hospitals had better knowledge than others in certain areas and resident surgeons had fewer correct answers in some areas. CONCLUSIONS: Although most surgeons have a good knowledge in most areas related to the diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic cancer in China, certain knowledge gaps exist, particularly among trainees and those from low level hospitals. Continuing medical education programs to improve these knowledge gaps should be implemented.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Like many other cancer patients, most pancreatic carcinoma patients suffer from severe weight loss. As shown in numerous studies with fish oil (FO) supplementation, a minimum daily intake of 1.5 g n-3-fatty acids (n-3-FA) contributes to weight stabilization and improvement of quality of life (QoL) of cancer patients. Given n-3-FA not as triglycerides (FO), but mainly bound to marine phospholipids (MPL), weight stabilization and improvement of QoL has already been seen at much lower doses of n-3-FA (0,3 g), and MPL were much better tolerated. The objective of this double-blind randomized controlled trial was to compare low dose MPL and FO formulations, which had the same n-3-FA amount and composition, on weight and appetite stabilization, global health enhancement (QoL), and plasma FA-profiles in patients suffering from pancreatic cancer. METHODS: Sixty pancreatic cancer patients were included into the study and randomized to take either FO- or MPL supplementation. Patients were treated with 0.3 g of n-3-fatty acids per day over six weeks. Since the n-3-FA content of FO is usually higher than that of MPL, FO was diluted with 40% of medium chain triglycerides (MCT) to achieve the same capsule size in both intervention groups and therefore assure blinding. Routine blood parameters, lipid profiles, body weight, and appetite were measured before and after intervention. Patient compliance was assessed through a patient diary. Quality of life and nutritional habits were assessed with validated questionnaires (EORTC-QLQ-C30, PAN26). Thirty one patients finalized the study protocol and were analyzed (per-protocol-analysis). RESULTS: Intervention with low dose n-3-FAs, either as FO or MPL supplementation, resulted in similar and promising weight and appetite stabilization in pancreatic cancer patients. MPL capsules were slightly better tolerated and showed fewer side effects, when compared to FO supplementation. CONCLUSION: The similar effects between both interventions were unexpected but reliable, since the MPL and FO formulations caused identical increases of n-3-FAs in plasma lipids of included patients after supplementation. The effects of FO with very low n-3-FA content might be explained by the addition of MCT. The results of this study suggest the need for further investigations of marine phospholipids for the improvement of QoL of cancer patients, optionally in combination with MCT.',\n",

       "  'AB': \"The relationships between diabetes and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) are complex. Longstanding type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is a risk factor for pancreatic cancer, but increasing epidemiological data point to PDAC as also a cause of diabetes due to unknown mechanisms. New-onset diabetes is of particular interest to the oncology community as the differentiation of new-onset diabetes caused by PDAC as distinct from T2DM may allow for earlier diagnosis of PDAC. To address these relationships and raise awareness of the relationships between PDAC and diabetes, a symposium entitled Diabetes, Pancreatogenic Diabetes, and Pancreatic Cancer was held at the American Diabetes Association's 76th Scientific Sessions in June 2016. This article summarizes the data presented at that symposium, describing the current understanding of the interrelationships between diabetes, diabetes management, and pancreatic cancer, and identifies areas where additional research is needed.\",\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Pancreatic cancer statistics are dismal, with a 5-year survival of less than 10%, and more than 50% of patients presenting with metastatic disease. Metabolic reprogramming is an emerging hallmark of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. CPI-613 is a novel anticancer agent that selectively targets the altered form of mitochondrial energy metabolism in tumour cells, causing changes in mitochondrial enzyme activities and redox status that lead to apoptosis, necrosis, and autophagy of tumour cells. We aimed to establish the maximum tolerated dose of CPI-613 when used in combination with modified FOLFIRINOX chemotherapy (comprising oxaliplatin, leucovorin, irinotecan, and fluorouracil) in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. METHODS: In this single-centre, open-label, dose-escalation phase 1 trial, we recruited adult patients (aged >/=18 years) with newly diagnosed metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma from the Comprehensive Cancer Center of Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center (Winston-Salem, NC, USA). Patients had good bone marrow, liver and kidney function, and good performance status (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group [ECOG] performance status 0-1). We studied CPI-613 in combination with modified FOLFIRINOX (oxaliplatin at 65 mg/m(2), leucovorin at 400 mg/m(2), irinotecan at 140 mg/m(2), and fluorouracil 400 mg/m(2) bolus followed by 2400 mg/m(2) over 46 h). We applied a two-stage dose-escalation scheme (single patient and traditional 3+3 design). In the single-patient stage, one patient was accrued per dose level. The starting dose of CPI-613 was 500 mg/m(2) per day; the dose level was then escalated by doubling the previous dose if there were no adverse events worse than grade 2 within 4 weeks attributed as probably or definitely related to CPI-613. The traditional 3+3 dose-escalation stage was triggered if toxic effects attributed as probably or definitely related to CPI-613 were grade 2 or worse. The dose level for CPI-613 for the first cohort in the traditional dose-escalation stage was the same as that used in the last cohort of the single-patient dose-escalation stage. The primary objective was to establish the maximum tolerated dose of CPI-613 (as assessed by dose-limiting toxicities). This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01835041, and is closed to recruitment. FINDINGS: Between April 22, 2013, and Jan 8, 2016, we enrolled 20 patients. The maximum tolerated dose of CPI-613 was 500 mg/m(2). The median number of treatment cycles given at the maximum tolerated dose was 11 (IQR 4-19). Median follow-up of the 18 patients treated at the maximum tolerated dose was 378 days (IQR 250-602). Two patients enrolled at a higher dose of 1000 mg/m(2), and both had a dose-limiting toxicity. Two unexpected serious adverse events occurred, both for the first patient enrolled. Expected serious adverse events were: thrombocytopenia, anaemia, and lymphopenia (all for patient number 2; anaemia and lymphopenia were dose-limiting toxicities); hyperglycaemia (in patient number 7); hypokalaemia, hypoalbuminaemia, and sepsis (patient number 11); and neutropenia (patient number 20). No deaths due to adverse events were reported. For the 18 patients given the maximum tolerated dose, the most common grade 3-4 non-haematological adverse events were hyperglycaemia (ten [55%] patients), hypokalaemia (six [33%]), peripheral sensory neuropathy (five [28%]), diarrhoea (five [28%]), and abdominal pain (four [22%]). The most common grade 3-4 haematological adverse events were neutropenia (five [28%] of 18 patients), lymphopenia (five [28%]), anaemia (four [22%], and thrombocytopenia in three [17%]). Sensory neuropathy (all grade 1-3) was recorded in 17 (94%) of the 18 patients and was managed with dose de-escalation or discontinuation per standard of care. No patients died while on active treatment; 11 study participants died, with cause of death as terminal pancreatic cancer. Of the 18 patients given the maximum tolerated dose, 11 (61%) achieved an objective (complete or partial) response. INTERPRETATION: A maximum tolerated dose of CPI-613 was established at 500 mg/m(2) when used in combination with modified FOLFIRINOX in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. The findings of clinical activity will require validation in a phase 2 trial. FUNDING: Comprehensive Cancer Center of Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Three randomised trials (GEST, JACCRO PC-01, and GEMSAP) were conducted to evaluate the efficacy of gemcitabine plus S-1 (GS) vs gemcitabine alone in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer (PC). In this pooled analysis, the efficacy and safety of GS vs gemcitabine were evaluated. METHODS: Additional follow-up was conducted and survival data were updated in each study. A total of 770 patients (gemcitabine 389; GS 381) were included in the pooled analysis. The efficacy and safety data were analysed according to disease extent: locally advanced PC (LAPC) or metastatic PC (MPC). RESULTS: There were 738 (95.8%) overall survival events. In patients with LAPC (n=193), the median survival was 11.83 months for gemcitabine and 16.41 months for GS (hazard ratio (HR)=0.708; 95% confidence intervals (CI), 0.527-0.951; P=0.0220). In patients with MPC (n=577), the median survival was 8.02 months for gemcitabine and 9.43 months for GS (HR=0.872; 95% CI, 0.738-1.032; P=0.1102). The rate of grade 3/4 toxicity (rash and thrombocytopenia in LAPC; rash, diarrhoea, vomiting, and neutropaenia in MPC) was significantly higher for GS than for gemcitabine. CONCLUSIONS: Gemcitabine plus S-1 is a viable treatment alternative to gemcitabine, which is one of the standard treatments in patients with LAPC.',\n",

       "  'AB': \"BACKGROUND: Olaparib is an oral inhibitor of polyadenosine 5'-diphosphoribose polymerization (PARP) that has previously shown signs of activity in patients with BRCA mutations and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this phase 1 dose-escalation trial in patients with unresectable PDAC, we determined the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of olaparib (tablet formulation) in combination with irinotecan 70 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8 and cisplatin 25 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8 of a 28-day cycle (olaparib plus IC). We then studied the safety and tolerability of adding mitomycin C 5 mg/m2 on day 1 to this regimen (olaparib plus ICM). RESULTS: 18 patients with unresectable PDAC were enrolled. The MTD of olaparib plus IC was olaparib 100 mg twice-daily on days 1 and 8. The addition of mitomycin C to this dose level was not tolerated. Grade >/=3 drug-related adverse events (AEs) were encountered in 16 patients (89%). The most common grade >/=3 drug-related toxicities included neutropenia (89%), lymphopenia (72%), and anemia (22%). Two patients (11%), both of whom had remained on study for more than 12 cycles, developed drug-related myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). The objective response rate (ORR) for all evaluable patients was 23%. One patient who carried a deleterious germline BRCA2 mutation had a durable clinical response lasting more than four years, but died from complications of treatment-related MDS. CONCLUSIONS: Olaparib had substantial toxicity when combined with IC or ICM in patients with PDAC, and this treatment combination did not have an acceptable risk/benefit profile for further study. However, durable clinical responses were observed in a subset of patients and further clinical investigation of PARP inhibitors in PDAC is warranted. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This clinical trial was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov as NCT01296763.\",\n",

       "  'AB': 'Pancreatic cancer is considered one of the most lethal cancers being the fourth leading cause of cancer deaths in adults in the United States because of the lack of early signs and symptoms and the lack of early detection. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the most common histological type among pancreatic cancers, representing 80%-90% of all solid tumors of the pancreas. The majority of PDAC develops from three precursor lesions: pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia, intraductual papillary mucinous neoplasm and mucinous cystic neoplasm. Although histologic tissue evaluation remains the gold standard for diagnosis, endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration has become the preferred modality for obtaining pathologic confirmation. At Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center (DHMC),we have developed and validated a microRNA (miRNA) panel for patients with pancreatic diseases that can be used in association with the gold standard method for diagnosis. miRNAs have an important role in biological processes, such as apoptosis, metabolism, cell growth and differentiation. In cancer, miRNAs can be classified as either oncogenic or tumor suppressor according to their function in the carcinogenic process. In this study, we describe the expression of many miRNA in benign and malignant pancreatic tissues as well as their clinical significance. For this reason, miRNAs have been considered potential biomarkers of pancreatic diseases that could potentially contribute to an early diagnosis, predict disease progression, accurately monitor disease, contribute to better treatment strategies and reduce mortality by improving disease management.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Pain caused by pancreatic cancer (PC) is difficult to control. Celiac plexus neurolysis (CPN) can effectively control the pain and reduce the use of opioids. However, the effect of CPN on survival for patients with unresectable PC remains controversial. OBJECTIVES: To determine if CPN is associated with survival benefits for these patients. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective, observational cohort study. SETTING: National Cancer Center in Korea. METHODS: The CPN group included patients who were diagnosed with unresectable PC and underwent fluoroscopically guided bilateral CPN (10 mL dehydrated alcohol each side) once between January 1, 2006, and December 31, 2013. Patients with PC who did not undergo CPN were in the control group; for the final control group, 1:1 propensity score (PS) matching was conducted with the CPN group. The main outcome was median survival (PC diagnosis to death) after PS matching, assessed using Kaplan-Meier curves. RESULTS: For the primary overall survival analysis, the CPN and control groups included 110 and 258 patients, respectively. The median survival period was not significantly different between the CPN and control groups (278 vs. 203 days, P = 0.246), even after PS matching (278 vs. 180 days, P = 0.127), or based on time to CPN from diagnosis (</= 6 vs. > 6 months; 255 vs. 310 days, P = 0.147). LIMITATIONS: Retrospective design, small sample size, and inconsistent timing of CPN after the diagnosis date. CONCLUSION: CPN did not affect survival for patients with unresectable PC. Considering the limitations of the retrospective design, a well-designed prospective design study should be conducted.Key words: Celiac plexus, pancreatic neoplasms, survival, neurolysis, pain, propensity score matching, opioids, cancer.',\n",

       "  'AB': \"AIM: To investigate the association between postoperative pain control and oncologic outcomes in resected pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). METHODS: From January 2009 to December 2014, 221 patients were diagnosed with PDAC and underwent resection with curative intent. Retrospective review of the patients was performed based on electronic medical records system. One patient without records of numerical rating scale (NRS) pain intensity scores was excluded and eight patients who underwent total pancreatectomy were also excluded. NRS scores during 7 postoperative days following resection of PDAC were reviewed along with clinicopathologic characteristics. Patients were stratified into a good pain control group and a poor pain control group according to the difference in average pain intensity between the early (POD 1, 2, 3) and late (POD 5, 7) postoperative periods. Cox-proportional hazards multivariate analysis was performed to determine association between postoperative pain control and oncologic outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 212 patients were dichotomized into good pain control group (n = 162) and poor pain control group (n = 66). Median follow-up period was 17 mo. A negative impact of poor postoperative pain control on overall survival (OS) was observed in the group of patients receiving distal pancreatectomy (DP group; 42.0 mo vs 5.0 mo, P = 0.001). Poor postoperative pain control was also associated with poor disease-free survival (DFS) in the DP group (18.0 mo vs 8.0 mo, P = 0.001). Patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy or pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD group) did not show associations between postoperative pain control and oncologic outcomes. Poor patients' perceived pain control was revealed as an independent risk factor of both DFS (HR = 4.157; 95%CI: 1.938-8.915; P < 0.001) and OS (HR = 4.741; 95%CI: 2.214-10.153; P < 0.001) in resected left-sided pancreatic cancer. CONCLUSION: Adequate postoperative pain relief during the early postoperative period has important clinical implications for oncologic outcomes after resection of left-sided pancreatic cancer.\",\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Despite considerable efforts by scientific research, pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer related mortalities. Sigma-2 receptors, which are overexpressed in several tumors, represent promising targets for triggering selective pancreatic cancer cells death. METHODS: We selected five differently structured high-affinity sigma-2 ligands (PB28, PB183, PB221, F281 and PB282) to study how they affect the viability of diverse pancreatic cancer cells (human cell lines BxPC3, AsPC1, Mia PaCa-2, and Panc1 and mouse Panc-02, KCKO and KP-02) and how this is reflected in vivo in a tumor model. RESULTS: Important cytotoxicity was shown by the compounds in the aggressive Panc02 cells, where cytotoxic activity was caspase-3 independent for four of the five compounds. However, both cytotoxicity and caspase-3 activation involved generation of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), which could be partially reverted by the lipid antioxidant alpha-tocopherol, but not by the hydrophilic N-acetylcysteine (NAC) indicating crucial differences in the intracellular sites exposed to oxidative stress induced by sigma-2 receptor ligands. Importantly, all the compounds strongly increased the production of mitochondrial superoxide radicals except for PB282. Despite a poor match between in vitro and the in vivo efficacy, daily treatment of C57BL/6 mice bearing Panc02 tumors resulted in promising effects with PB28 and PB282 which were similar compared to the current standard-of-care chemotherapeutic gemcitabine without showing signs of systemic toxicities. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, this study identified differential sensitivities of pancreatic cancer cells to structurally diverse sigma-2 receptor ligands. Of note, we identified the mitochondrial superoxide pathway as a previously unrecognized sigma-2 receptor-activated process, which encourages further studies on sigma-2 ligand-mediated cancer cell death for the targeted treatment of pancreatic tumors.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells (PCC) have an exceptional propensity to metastasize early into intratumoral, chemokine-secreting nerves. However, we hypothesized the opposite process, that precancerous pancreatic cells secrete chemokines that chemoattract Schwann cells (SC) of nerves and thus induce ready-to-use routes of dissemination in early carcinogenesis. Here we show a peculiar role for the chemokine CXCL12 secreted in early PDAC and for its receptors CXCR4/CXCR7 on SC in the initiation of neural invasion in the cancer precursor stage and the resulting delay in the onset of PDAC-associated pain. SC exhibited cancer- or hypoxia-induced CXCR4/CXCR7 expression in vivo and in vitro and migrated toward CXCL12-expressing PCC. Glia-specific depletion of CXCR4/CXCR7 in mice abrogated the chemoattraction of SC to PCC. PDAC mice with pancreas-specific CXCL12 depletion exhibited diminished SC chemoattraction to pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia and increased abdominal hypersensitivity caused by augmented spinal astroglial and microglial activity. In PDAC patients, reduced CXCR4/CXCR7 expression in nerves correlated with increased pain. Mechanistically, upon CXCL12 exposure, SC down-regulated the expression of several pain-associated targets. Therefore, PDAC-derived CXCL12 seems to induce tumor infiltration by SC during early carcinogenesis and to attenuate pain, possibly resulting in delayed diagnosis in PDAC.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Cancer cachexia represents a debilitating syndrome that diminishes quality of life and augments the toxicities of conventional treatments. Cancer cachexia is particularly debilitating in patients with pancreatic cancer (PC). Mechanisms responsible for cancer cachexia are under investigation and are largely derived from observations in syngeneic murine models of cancer which are limited in PC. We evaluate the effect of human PC cells on both muscle wasting and the systemic inflammatory milieu potentially contributing to PC-associated cachexia. Specifically, human PC xenografts were generated by implantation of pancreatic cancer cells, L3.6pl and PANC-1, either in the flank or orthotopically within the pancreas. Mice bearing orthotopic xenografts demonstrated significant muscle wasting and atrophy-associated gene expression changes compared to controls. Further, despite the absence of adaptive immunity, splenic tissue from orthotopically engrafted mice demonstrated elevations in several pro-inflammatory cytokines associated with cancer cachexia, including TNFalpha, IL1beta, IL6 and KC (murine IL8 homologue), when compared to controls. Therefore, data presented here support further investigation into the complexity of cancer cachexia in PC to identify potential targets for this debilitating syndrome.',\n",

       "  'PG': '2722-2732',\n",
       "  'AB': 'Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the United States. Aggressive treatment regimens have not changed the disease course, and the median survival has just recently reached a year. Several mechanisms are proposed to play a role in PDAC therapeutic resistance, including hypoxia, which creates a more aggressive phenotype with increased metastatic potential and impaired therapeutic efficacy. AP Endonuclease-1/Redox Effector Factor 1 (APE1/Ref-1) is a multifunctional protein possessing a DNA repair function in base excision repair and the ability to reduce oxidized transcription factors, enabling them to bind to their DNA target sequences. APE1/Ref-1 regulates several transcription factors involved in survival mechanisms, tumor growth, and hypoxia signaling. Here, we explore the mechanisms underlying PDAC cell responses to hypoxia and modulation of APE1/Ref-1 redox signaling activity, which regulates the transcriptional activation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF1alpha). Carbonic anhydrase IX (CA9) is regulated by HIF1alpha and functions as a part of the cellular response to hypoxia to regulate intracellular pH, thereby promoting cell survival. We hypothesized that modulating APE1/Ref-1 function will block activation of downstream transcription factors, STAT3 and HIF1alpha, interfering with the hypoxia-induced gene expression. We demonstrate APE1/Ref-1 inhibition in patient-derived and established PDAC cells results in decreased HIF1alpha-mediated induction of CA9. Furthermore, an ex vivo three-dimensional tumor coculture model demonstrates dramatic enhancement of APE1/Ref-1-induced cell killing upon dual targeting of APE1/Ref-1 and CA9. Both APE1/Ref-1 and CA9 are under clinical development; therefore, these studies have the potential to direct novel PDAC therapeutic treatment. Mol Cancer Ther; 15(11); 2722-32. (c)2016 AACR.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Methylation at cg 16941656 of FRY is exclusively found in normal pancreatic tissue and has been proven to be specific for pancreatic-in-origin among several adenocarcinomas. Here, we investigated methylated DNA in the bile as a biomarker to differentiate the cause of obstruction between pancreatic cancer and benign causes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Bile samples of 45 patients with obstructive jaundice who underwent ERCP were collected and classified into pancreatic cancer (group 1) and benign causes (group 2) in 24 and 21 patients, respectively. DNA was extracted from bile and bisul te modification was performed. After, methylation in cg 16941656 of FRY was identified by real-time PCR, with beta-actin used as a positive control. RESULTS: Methylated DNA was identified in 10/24 (41.67%) and 1/21 (4.8%) of cases in groups 1 and 2, respectively (P= 0.012). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value to differentiate pancreatic cancer from benign causes were 42%, 95%, 91%, and 59%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Detecting a methylation at cg 16941656 of FRY in bile has high specificity, with an acceptable positive likelihood rate, and may therefore be helpful in distinguishing pancreatic cancer from benign strictures.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'The contribution of integrin alpha6beta4 (alpha6beta4) overexpression to the pancreatic cancer invasion and metastasis has been previously shown. We have reported immunotargeting of alpha6beta4 for radionuclide-based and near-infrared fluorescence imaging in a pancreatic cancer model. In this study, we prepared yttrium-90 labeled anti-alpha6beta4 antibody (90Y-ITGA6B4) and evaluated its radioimmunotherapeutic efficacy against pancreatic cancer xenografts in nude mice. Mice bearing xenograft tumors were randomly divided into 5 groups: (1) single administration of 90Y-ITGA6B4 (3.7MBq), (2) double administrations of 90Y-ITGA6B4 with once-weekly schedule (3.7MBq x 2), (3) single administration of unlabeled ITGA6B4, (4) double administrations of unlabeled ITGA6B4 with once-weekly schedule and (5) the untreated control. Biweekly tumor volume measurements and immunohistochemical analyses of tumors at 2 days post-administration were performed to monitor the response to treatments. To assess the toxicity, body weight was measured biweekly. Additionally, at 27 days post-administration, blood samples were collected through cardiac puncture, and hematological parameters, hepatic and renal functions were analyzed. Both 90Y-ITGA6B4 treatment groups showed reduction in tumor volumes (P < 0.04), decreased cell proliferation marker Ki-67-positive cells and increased DNA damage marker p-H2AX-positive cells, compared with the other groups. Mice treated with double administrations of 90Y-ITGA6B4, exhibited myelosuppression. There were no significant differences in hepatic and renal functions between the 2 treatment groups and the other groups. Our results suggest that 90Y-ITGA6B4 is a promising radioimmunotherapeutic agent against alpha6beta4 overexpressing tumors. In the future studies, dose adjustment for fractionated RIT should be considered carefully in order to get the optimal effect while avoiding myelotoxicity.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'The role of bile acids in colorectal cancer has been well documented, but their role in pancreatic cancer remains unclear. In this review, we examined the risk factors of pancreatic cancer. We found that bile acids are associated with most of these factors. Alcohol intake, smoking, and a high-fat diet all lead to high secretion of bile acids, and bile acid metabolic dysfunction is a causal factor of gallstones. An increase in secretion of bile acids, in addition to a long common channel, may result in bile acid reflux into the pancreatic duct and to the epithelial cells or acinar cells, from which pancreatic adenocarcinoma is derived. The final pathophysiological process is pancreatitis, which promotes dedifferentiation of acinar cells into progenitor duct-like cells. Interestingly, bile acids act as regulatory molecules in metabolism, affecting adipose tissue distribution, insulin sensitivity and triglyceride metabolism. As a result, bile acids are associated with three risk factors of pancreatic cancer: obesity, diabetes and hypertriglyceridemia. In the second part of this review, we summarize several studies showing that bile acids act as cancer promoters in gastrointestinal cancer. However, more question are raised than have been solved, and further oncological and physiological experiments are needed to confirm the role of bile acids in pancreatic cancer carcinogenesis.',\n",

       "  'AB': \"Pancreatic cancer is one of the most aggressive human cancers. PD1/PDL1-inhibitors recently showed promising results in different cancers with correlation between PDL1 tumor expression and responses. Expression of programmed cell death receptor ligand 1 (PDL1) has been scarcely studied in pancreatic cancer. In this retrospective study, we analyzed PDL1 mRNA expression in 453 clinical pancreatic cancer samples profiled using DNA microarrays and RNASeq. Compared to normal pancreatic samples, PDL1 expression was upregulated in 19% of cancer samples. Upregulation was not associated with clinicopathological features such as patients' age and sex, pathological type, tumor size, lymph node status, and grade, but was associated with shorter disease-free survival and overall survival in multivariate analyses. Analysis of correlations with biological parameters showed that PDL1 upregulation was associated with some degree of lymphocyte infiltration and signs of anti-tumor T-cell response, but to a lesser extent than what has been reported in breast cancer and GIST. PDL1-up pancreatic cancers displayed profiles of lymphocyte exhaustion, were more enriched in inhibitory molecules and pro-tumor populations (Tregs with upregulation of FOXP3 and IL10, myeloid-derived suppressor cells with upregulation of CD33 and S100A8/A9), and demonstrated a down-modulation of most MHC class I members (HLA-A/B/C, HLA-E/F/G) suggestive of a defect in antigen processing and presentation. In conclusion, our results suggest that PDL1 expression might refine the prediction of metastatic relapse in operated pancreatic cancer, and that PD1/PDL1 inhibitors might reactivate inhibited T-cells to increase the anti-tumor immune response in PDL1-upregulated tumors.\",\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus is frequently observed in pancreatic cancer patients and is both a risk factor and an early manifestation of the disease. METHODS: We analysed the prognostic impact of diabetes on the outcome of pancreatic cancer following resection and adjuvant chemotherapy using individual patient data from three European Study Group for Pancreatic Cancer randomised controlled trials. Analyses were carried out to assess the association between clinical characteristics and the presence of preoperative diabetes, as well as the effect of diabetic status on overall survival. RESULTS: In total, 1105 patients were included in the analysis, of whom 257 (23%) had confirmed diabetes and 848 (77%) did not. Median (95% confidence interval (CI)) unadjusted overall survival in non-diabetic patients was 22.3 (20.8-24.1) months compared with 18.8 (16.9-22.1) months for diabetic patients (P=0.24). Diabetic patients were older, had increased weight and more co-morbidities. Following adjustment, multivariable analysis demonstrated that diabetic patients had an increased risk of death (hazard ratio: 1.19 (95% CI 1.01, 1.40), P=0.034). Maximum tumour size of diabetic patients was larger at randomisation (33.6 vs 29.7 mm, P=0.026). CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes mellitus was associated with increased tumour size and reduced survival following pancreatic cancer resection and adjuvant chemotherapy.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'PURPOSE: We previously reported clinical outcomes and physician-reported toxicity of gemcitabine and hypofractionated stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) in locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC). Here we prospectively investigate the impact of gemcitabine and SBRT on patient-reported quality of life (QoL). METHODS AND MATERIALS: Forty-nine LAPC patients received 33 Gy SBRT (6.6 Gy daily fractions) upfront or after </=3 doses of gemcitabine (1000 mg/m(2)) followed by gemcitabine until progression. European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer QoL core cancer (QLQ-C30) and pancreatic cancer-specific (European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ-PAN26) questionnaires were administered to patients pre-SBRT and at 4 to 6 weeks (first follow-up [1FUP]) and 4 months (2FUP) post-SBRT. Changes in QoL scores were deemed clinically relevant if median changes were at least 5 points in magnitude. RESULTS: Forty-three (88%) patients completed pre-SBRT questionnaires. Of these, 88% and 51% completed questionnaires at 1FUP and 2FUP, respectively. There was no change in global QoL from pre-SBRT to 1FUP (P = .17) or 2FUP (P > .99). Statistical and clinical improvements in pancreatic pain (P = .001) and body image (P = .007) were observed from pre-SBRT to 1FUP. Patients with 1FUP and 2FUP questionnaires reported statistically and clinically improved body image (P = .016) by 4 months. Although pancreatic pain initially demonstrated statistical and clinical improvement (P = .020), scores returned to enrollment levels by 2FUP (P = .486). A statistical and clinical decline in role functioning (P = .002) was observed in patients at 2FUP. CONCLUSIONS: Global QoL scores are not reduced with gemcitabine and SBRT. In this exploratory analysis, patients experience clinically relevant short-term improvements in pancreatic cancer-specific symptoms. Previously demonstrated acceptable clinical outcomes combined with these favorable QoL data indicate that SBRT can be easily integrated with other systemic therapies and may be a potential standard of care option in patients with LAPC.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is characterized by its hypovascularity, with an extremely poor prognosis because of its highly invasive nature. PDAC proliferates with abundant stromal cells, suggesting that its invasive activity might be controlled by intercellular interactions between cancer cells and fibroblasts. Using four PDAC cell lines and two pancreas cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), the expression of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF1) and IGF1 receptor (IGF1R) was evaluated by RT-PCR, FACScan, western blot, or ELISA. Correlation between IGF1R and the hypoxia marker carbonic anhydrase 9 (CA9) was examined by immunohistochemical staining of 120 pancreatic specimens. The effects of CAFs, IGF1, and IGF1R inhibitors on the motility of cancer cells were examined by wound-healing assay or invasion assay under normoxia (20% O2) and hypoxia (1% O2). IGF1R expression was significantly higher in RWP-1, MiaPaCa-2, and OCUP-AT cells than in Panc-1 cells. Hypoxia increased the expression level of IGF1R in RWP-1, MiaPaCa-2, and OCUP-AT cells. CA9 expression was correlated with IGF1R expression in pancreatic specimens. CAFs produced IGF1 under hypoxia, but PDAC cells did not. A conditioned medium from CAFs, which expressed alphaSMA, stimulated the migration and invasion ability of MiaPaCa-2, RWP-1, and OCUP-AT cells. The motility of all PDAC cells was greater under hypoxia than under normoxia. The motility-stimulating ability of CAFs was decreased by IGF1R inhibitors. These findings might suggest that pancreas CAFs stimulate the invasion activity of PDAC cells through paracrine IGF1/IGF1R signaling, especially under hypoxia. Therefore the targeting of IGF1R signaling might represent a promising therapeutic approach in IGF1R-dependent PDAC.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'PURPOSE: NEO-102 is a novel chimeric IgG1 monoclonal antibody which recognizes a variant form of MUC5AC expressed specifically by human pancreatic and colorectal tumors. Preclinical models have demonstrated encouraging signs of anti-tumor activity through antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. METHODS: This is a phase 1, dose-escalation trial of NEO-102 (Ensituximab) for patients with refractory pancreatic and colorectal cancer. The primary objective was to determine safety and tolerability of escalating doses of NEO-102. Secondary objectives were to assess pharmacokinetics, anti-tumor activity and biologic correlates. Patients whose tumors express NPC-1 antigen were eligible. Dose-escalation was performed in a 3 + 3 design at doses of 1.5, 2, 3 and 4 mg/kg. RESULTS: A total of 19 patients (4 pancreatic and 15 colon cancer) were enrolled at participating institutions in the treatment phase. Most common treatment-related adverse events included anemia, fatigue, fevers, chills and flushing. There was no detectable hemolysis. Of twelve patients evaluable for disease response, the response rate at week 8 included 5 patients with stable disease and 8 patients with progressive disease (PD). Treatment-related grade 3/4 hyperbilirubinemia and anemia were observed at 4 mg/m2. Reversible hypoxia at 3 mg/kg was a dose-limiting toxicity. The maximum tolerated dose was established at 3 mg/kg. Of 74 patients who underwent tissue screening, positive NPC-1 expression was 47 % in colon and 59 % in pancreatic cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with the NEO-102, in this first-in-human study, is well tolerated with a manageable safety profile. A maximum tolerated dose of 3 mg/kg has been established. Toxicity profile is typical for this therapeutic class and allows for combination with conventional cytotoxic therapies.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'OBJECTIVE: To retrospectively evaluate possible impact factors of HIFU treatment outcome for unresectable pancreatic cancer patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 689 patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer were recruited in our center from December 30, 2007 to January 30, 2015. 436 patients with unresectable pancreatic cancers received HIFU treatment; the other 253 patients received non-HIFU treatment. Among these 436 patients, 345 patients received a one-time HIFU treatment, 91 patients received HIFU treatment from 2 to 5 times in the same pancreatic mass; 89 patients received HIFU treatment alone; 347 patients received HIFU-based combined therapies. Complications and overall survivals (OS) data in each group were collected. RESULTS: The median overall survivals (mOS) in HIFU group and non-HIFU group were 7.1 vs. 5 months (P=0.005): 9.3 vs. 7.3 months (P=0.202) for patients with stage II disease, 8.3 vs. 7.3 months (P=0.783) for patients with stage III disease, and 6.4 vs. 4.2 months (P<0.0001) for patients with stage IV disease, respectively. Furthermore, there was a significant difference between repeated HIFU and one-time HIFU (mOS: 8.6 vs. 6.8 months, P=0.011). Time of HIFU treatment (P=0.0027), chemotherapy (P<0.0001), radiotherapy (P=0.0006), regional intra-arterial chemotherapy (RIAC) (P<0.0001), and stage (P<0.0001) were independent prognostic factors for the patients who received HIFU treatment. Cox analysis on the relative risk of prognostic factors showed that repeated HIFU vs. one-time HIFU (HR=0.729: 95% CI=0.576-0.924), chemotherapy vs. non-chemotherapy (HR=0.664: 95% CI=0.576-0.766), radiotherapy vs. non-radiotherapy (HR=0.580: 95% CI=0.427-0.789), RIAC vs. non-RIAC (HR=0.737: 95% CI=0.648-0.837), and stage (HR=1.386, 95% CI=1.187-1.619) were associated with significantly inferior survival. Overall, adverse events occurred in 23.2% (101/436) in the HIFU group, which included increase of serum or urinary amylase levels, incomplete intestinal obstruction, mild fever, etc. There were no severe adverse events such as skin burns or GI perforation related to HIFU therapy in any of the patients treated. CONCLUSION: This retrospective analysis revealed that the use of a multimodal treatment approach (the combined therapy of HIFU, RIAC, and chemotherapy, with or without radiotherapy) could improve survival of patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer, and repeated HIFU presented a survival benefit and did not increase risk.',\n",

In this study, we have synthesized a hypoxia-responsive, diblock copolymer poly(lactic acid)-azobenzene-poly(ethylene glycol), which self-assembles to form polymersomes in an aqueous medium. The polymersomes did not release any encapsulated contents for 50 min under normoxic conditions. However, under hypoxia, 90% of the encapsulated dye was released in 50 min. The polymersomes encapsulated the combination of anticancer drugs gemcitabine and erlotinib with entrapment efficiency of 40% and 28%, respectively. We used three-dimensional spheroid cultures of pancreatic cancer cells BxPC-3 to demonstrate hypoxia-mediated release of the drugs from the polymersomes. The vesicles were nontoxic. However, a significant decrease in cell viability was observed in hypoxic spheroidal cultures of BxPC-3 cells in the presence of drug encapsulated polymersomes. These polymersomes have potential for future applications in imaging and treatment of hypoxic tumors.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'PURPOSE: Evaluation of ultrasound-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) used for the first time in Germany in patients with inoperable pancreatic cancer for reduction of tumor volume and relief of tumor-associated pain. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 15 patients with locally advanced inoperable pancreatic cancer and tumor-related pain symptoms were treated by HIFU (n = 6 UICC stage III, n = 9 UICC stage IV). 13 patients underwent simultaneous standard chemotherapy. Ablation was performed using the JC HIFU system (Chongqing, China HAIFU Company) with an ultrasonic device for real-time imaging. Imaging follow-up (US, CT, MRI) and clinical assessment using validated questionnaires (NRS, BPI) was performed before and up to 15 months after HIFU. RESULTS: Despite biliary or duodenal stents (4/15) and encasement of visceral vessels (15/15), HIFU treatment was performed successfully in all patients. Treatment time and sonication time were 111 min and 1103 s, respectively. The applied total energy was 386 768 J. After HIFU ablation, contrast-enhanced imaging showed devascularization of treated tumor regions with a significant average volume reduction of 63.8 % after 3 months. Considerable pain relief was achieved in 12 patients after HIFU (complete or partial pain reduction in 6 patients). CONCLUSION: US-guided HIFU with a suitable acoustic pathway can be used for local tumor control and relief of tumor-associated pain in patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer. KEY POINTS: * US-guided HIFU allows an additive treatment of unresectable pancreatic cancer.* HIFU can be used for tumor volume reduction.* Using HIFU, a significant reduction of cancer-related pain was achieved.* HIFU provides clinical benefit in patients with pancreatic cancer.

       "  'AB': 'It remains unclear how obesity worsens treatment outcomes in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). In normal pancreas, obesity promotes inflammation and fibrosis. We found in mouse models of PDAC that obesity also promotes desmoplasia associated with accelerated tumor growth and impaired delivery/efficacy of chemotherapeutics through reduced perfusion. Genetic and pharmacologic inhibition of angiotensin-II type-1 receptor reverses obesity-augmented desmoplasia and tumor growth and improves response to chemotherapy. Augmented activation of pancreatic stellate cells (PSC) in obesity is induced by tumor-associated neutrophils (TAN) recruited by adipocyte-secreted IL1beta. PSCs further secrete IL1beta, and inactivation of PSCs reduces IL1beta expression and TAN recruitment. Furthermore, depletion of TANs, IL1beta inhibition, or inactivation of PSCs prevents obesity-accelerated tumor growth. In patients with pancreatic cancer, we confirmed that obesity is associated with increased desmoplasia and reduced response to chemotherapy. We conclude that cross-talk between adipocytes, TANs, and PSCs exacerbates desmoplasia and promotes tumor progression in obesity. SIGNIFICANCE: Considering the current obesity pandemic, unraveling the mechanisms underlying obesity-induced cancer progression is an urgent need. We found that the aggravation of desmoplasia is a key mechanism of obesity-promoted PDAC progression. Importantly, we discovered that clinically available antifibrotic/inflammatory agents can improve the treatment response of PDAC in obese hosts. Cancer Discov; 6(8); 852-69.

       "  'AB': 'TH-302 is a hypoxia-activated prodrug known to activate selectively under the hypoxic conditions commonly found in solid tumors. It is currently being evaluated in clinical trials, including two trials in Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinomas (PDAC). The current study was undertaken to evaluate imaging biomarkers for prediction and response monitoring of TH-302 efficacy in xenograft models of PDAC. Dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) and diffusion weighted (DW) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were used to monitor acute effects on tumor vasculature and cellularity, respectively. Three human PDAC xenografts with known differential responses to TH-302 were imaged prior to, and at 24 h and 48 hours following a single dose of TH-302 or vehicle to determine if imaging changes presaged changes in tumor volumes. DW-MRI was performed at five b-values to generate apparent diffusion coefficient of water (ADC) maps. For DCE-MRI, a standard clinically available contrast reagent, Gd-DTPA, was used to determine blood flow into the tumor region of interest. TH-302 induced a dramatic decrease in the DCE transfer constant (Ktrans) within 48 hours after treatment in the sensitive tumors, Hs766t and Mia PaCa-2, whereas TH-302 had no effect on the perfusion behavior of resistant SU.86.86 tumors. Tumor cellularity, estimated from ADC, was significantly increased 24 and 48 hours after treatment in Hs766t, but was not observed in the Mia PaCa-2 and SU.86.86 groups. Notably, growth inhibition of Hs766t was observed immediately (day 3) following initiation of treatment, but was not observed in MiaPaCa-2 tumors until 8 days after initiation of treatment. Based on these preclinical findings, DCE-MRI measures of vascular perfusion dynamics and ADC measures of cell density are suggested as potential TH-302 response biomarkers in clinical trials.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'The tumor microenvironment is replete with cells that evolve with and provide support to tumor cells during the transition to malignancy. The hijacking of the immune system in the pancreatic tumor microenvironment is suggested to contribute to the failure to date to produce significant improvements in pancreatic cancer survival by various chemotherapeutics. Regulatory T cells, myeloid derived suppressor cells, and fibroblasts, all of which constitute a complex ecology microenvironment, can suppress CD8+ T cells and NK cells, thus inhibiting effector immune responses. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) are versatile immune cells that can express different functional programs in response to stimuli in tumor microenvironment at different stages of pancreatic cancer development. TAM have been implicated in suppression of anti-tumorigenic immune responses, promotion of cancer cell proliferation, stimulation of tumor angiogenesis and extracellular matrix breakdown, and subsequent enhancement of tumor invasion and metastasis. Many emerging agents that have demonstrated efficacy in combating other types of tumors via modulation of macrophages in tumor microenvironments are, however, only marginally studied for pancreatic cancer prevention and treatment. A better understanding of the paradoxical roles of TAM in pancreatic cancer may pave the way to novel preventive and therapeutic approaches. Here we give an overview of the recruitment and differentiation of macrophages, TAM and pancreatic cancer progression and prognosis, as well as the potential preventive and therapeutic targets that interact with TAM for pancreatic cancer prevention and treatment.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Pancreatic cancer (PC) and associated pre-neoplastic lesions have been reported to be hypoxic, primarily due to hypovascular nature of PC. Though the presence of hypoxia under cancerous condition has been associated with the overexpression of oncogenic proteins (MUC1), multiple emerging reports have also indicated the growth inhibitory effects of hypoxia. In spite of being recognized as the top-most differentially expressed and established oncogenic protein in PC, MUC4 regulation in terms of micro-environmental stress has not been determined. Herein, for the first time, we are reporting that MUC4 protein stability is drastically affected in PC, under hypoxic condition in a hypoxia inducible factor 1alpha (HIF-1alpha)-independent manner. Mechanistically, we have demonstrated that hypoxia-mediated induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) promotes autophagy by inhibiting pAkt/mTORC1 pathway, one of the central regulators of autophagy. Immunohistofluorescence analyses revealed significant negative correlation (P-value=0.017) between 8-hydroxy guanosine (8-OHG) and MUC4 in primary pancreatic tumors (n=25). Moreover, we found pronounced colocalization between MUC4 and LAMP1/LC3 (microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3) in PC tissues and also observed their negative relationship in their expression pattern, suggesting that areas with high autophagy rate had less MUC4 expression. We also found that hypoxia and ROS have negative impact on overall cell growth and viability, which was partially, though significantly (P<0.05), rescued in the presence of MUC4. Altogether, hypoxia-mediated oxidative stress induces autophagy in PC, leading to the MUC4 degradation to enhance survival, possibly by offering required metabolites to stressed cells.',\n",

       "  'AB': \"BACKGROUND: Pancreatic cancer is a malignant neoplasm with a high mortality rate, often associated with a delayed diagnosis, the early occurrence of metastasis and an overall, poor response to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Pain management in pancreatic cancer consists mainly of pharmacological treatment according to the WHO analgesic ladder. Surgical treatment for pain relief, such as splanchnicectomy, is considered amongst the final step of pain management. It has been proven that splanchnicectomy is a safe procedure with a small percentage of complications, nevertheless, it is often used as a last resort, which can significantly decrease its effectiveness. Performance of thoracoscopic splanchnicectomy along the first step of the analgesic ladder may lead to long-lasting protection against the presence and severity of pain. METHODS/DESIGN: A prospective, open label, 1:1 randomized, controlled trial, conducted at a single institution to determine the effectiveness of invasive treatment of pain via splanchnicectomy, in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. The size of tested group will consist of 26 participants in each arm of the trial, to evaluate the level of pain relief and its impact on quality of life. To evaluate the influence on patients' rate of overall survival, a sample size of 105 patients is necessary, in each trial arm. Assessments will not only include the usage of analgesic pharmacotherapy throughout the course of disease, and overall patient survival, but also subjective pain perception at rest, in movement, and after meals (measured by NRS score questionnaire), the patient's quality of life (measured using the QLQ-C30 and FACIT questionnaires), and any pain-related suffering (measured with the PRISM projection test). The primary endpoint will consist of pain intensity. Questionnaires will be obtained upon the initial visit, the day of surgery, the day after surgery, as well as during long-term follow-up visits, held every two weeks thereafter. DISCUSSION: Earlier implementation of invasive treatment, such as thoracoscopic splanchnicectomy, can provide a higher efficacy of pain management, prevent deterioration in the patient's quality of life, and lengthen their overall survival.

       "  'AB': 'Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States. Due to the aggressive tumor biology and late manifestations of the disease, long-term survival is extremely uncommon and the current 5-year survival rate is 7%. Over the last two decades, endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) has evolved from a diagnostic modality to a minimally invasive therapeutic alternative to radiologic procedures and surgery for pancreatic diseases. EUS-guided celiac plexus intervention is a useful adjunct to conventional analgesia for patients with pancreatic cancer. EUS-guided biliary drainage has emerged as a viable option in patients who have failed endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. Recently, the use of lumen-apposing metal stent to create gastrojejunal anastomosis under EUS and fluoroscopic guidance in patients with malignant gastric outlet obstruction has been reported. On the other hand, anti-tumor therapies delivered by EUS, such as the injection of anti-tumor agents, brachytherapy and ablations are still in the experimental stage without clear survival benefit. In this article, we provide updates on well-established EUS-guided interventions as well as novel techniques relevant to pancreatic cancer.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Progressive loss of skeletal muscle, termed muscle wasting, is a hallmark of cancer cachexia and contributes to weakness, reduced quality of life, as well as poor response to therapy. Previous studies have indicated that systemic host inflammatory response regarding tumor development results in muscle wasting. However, how tumor directly regulates muscle wasting via tumor-derived secreted proteins is still largely unknown. METHODS: In this study, we performed bioinformatics analysis in two datasets of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, which causes cancer cachexia and muscle wasting with the highest prevalence, and uncovered that IGFBP3, which encodes IGF-binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3), is dramatically up-regulated in pancreatic tumor samples. We also verified the wasting effect of IGFBP-3 on C2C12 muscle cells with biochemical and genetic assays. RESULTS: IGFBP-3 potently leads to impaired myogenesis and enhanced muscle protein degradation, the major features of muscle wasting, via IGF signaling inhibition. Moreover, conditioned medium from Capan-1 pancreatic cancer cells, which contains abundant IGFBP-3, significantly induces muscle cell wasting. This wasting effect is potently alleviated by IGFBP3 knockdown in Capan-1 cells or IGFBP-3 antibody neutralization. Strikingly, compared to muscle cells, IGF signaling and proliferation rate of Capan-1 cells were rarely affected by IGFBP-3 treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrated that pancreatic cancer cells induce muscle wasting via IGFBP-3 production.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the fourth cause of cancer death with an overall survival of 5% at five years. The development of PDAC is characteristically associated to the accumulation of distinctive genetic mutations and is preceded by the exposure to several risk factors. Epidemiology has demonstrated that PDAC risk factors may be non-modifiable risks (sex, age, presence of genetic mutations, ethnicity) and modifiable and co-morbidity factors related to the specific habits and lifestyle. Recently it has become evident that obesity and diabetes are two important modifiable risk factors for PDAC. Obesity and diabetes are complex systemic and intertwined diseases and, over the years, experimental evidence indicate that insulin-resistance, alteration of adipokines, especially leptin and adiponectin, oxidative stress and inflammation may play a role in PDAC. Peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma) is a nuclear receptor transcription factor that is implicated in the regulation of metabolism, differentiation and inflammation. PPARgamma is a key regulator of adipocytes differentiation, regulates insulin and adipokines production and secretion, may modulate inflammation, and it is implicated in PDAC. PPARgamma agonists are used in the treatment of diabetes and oxidative stress-associated diseases and have been evaluated for the treatment of PDAC. PPARgamma is at the cross-road of diabetes, obesity, and PDAC and it is an interesting target to pharmacologically prevent PDAC in obese and diabetic patients.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Abdominal pain is a critical clinical symptom in pancreatic cancer (PC) that affects the quality of life for PC patients. However, the pathogenesis of PC pain is largely unknown. In this study, we show that PC pain is initiated by the sonic hedgehog (sHH) signaling pathway in pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs), which is activated by sHH secreted from PC cells, and then, neurotrophic factors derived from PSCs mediate the pain. The different culture systems were established in vitro, and the expression of sHH pathway molecules, neurotrophic factors, TRPV1, and pain factors were examined. Capsaicin-evoked TRPV1 currents in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons were examined by the patch-clamp technique. Pain-related behavior was observed in an orthotopic tumor model. sHH and PSCs increased the expression and secretion of TRPV1, SP, and CGRP by inducing NGF and BDNF in a co-culture system, also increasing TRPV1 current. But, suppressing sHH pathway or NGF reduced the expression of TRPV1, SP, and CGRP. In vivo, PSCs and PC cells that expressed high levels of sHH could enhance pain behavior. Furthermore, the blockade of NGF or TRPV1 significantly attenuated the pain response to mechanical stimulation compared with the control. Our results demonstrate that sHH signaling pathway is involved in PC pain, and PSCs play an essential role in the process greatly by inducing NGF.',\n",

Weight loss due to fat and muscle depletion is a hallmark of pancreatic cancer and is associated with worse outcomes. Studies of curcumin's effects on muscularity show conflicting results in animal models. METHODS AND RESULTS: Retrospective matched 1:2 case-control study to evaluate the effects of curcumin on body composition (determined by computerized tomography) of 66 patients with advanced pancreatic cancer (22 treated,44 controls). Average age (SEM) was 63(1.8) years, 30/66(45%) women, median number of prior therapies was 2, median (IQR) time from advanced pancreatic cancer diagnosis to baseline image was 7(2-13.5) months (p>0.2, all variables). All patients lost weight (3.3% and 1.3%, treated vs. control, p=0.13). Treated patients lost more muscle (median [IQR] percent change -4.8[-9.1,-0.1] vs. -0.05%[-4.2, 2.6] in controls,p<0.001) and fat (median [IQR] percent change -6.8%[-15,-0.6] vs. -4.0%[-7.6, 1.3] in controls,p=0.04). Subcutaneous fat was more affected in the treated patients. Sarcopenic patients treated with curcumin(n=15) had survival of 169(115-223) days vs. 299(229-369) sarcopenic controls(p=0.024). No survival difference was found amongst non-sarcopenic patients. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with advanced pancreatic cancer treated with curcumin showed significantly greater loss of subcutaneous fat and muscle than matched untreated controls.\",\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Advanced pancreatic cancer (PC) has very poor prognosis with present treatments, thus necessitating continued efforts to find improved therapeutic approaches. Both preclinical and preliminary clinical data indicate that cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells are an effective tool against various types of solid tumors. Here, we conducted a study to determine whether CIK cell-based therapy (CBT) can improve the outcomes of advanced PC. METHODS: Eighty-two patients with advanced PC, whose predicted survival time was longer than 3 months, were analyzed retrospectively. Of all the patients, 57 individuals were receiving chemotherapy, while the remaining 25 individuals were treated with CBT. RESULTS: The overall survival analysis was based on 48 deaths in the 57 patients in the chemotherapy group (84.2%) and 18 deaths in the 25 patients in the CBT group (72.0%). In the CBT group, the median overall survival time was 13.5 months, as compared to 6.6 months in the chemotherapy group (hazard ratio for death, 0.39; 95% confidence interval, 0.23 to 0.65; p < 0.001). The survival rate was 88.9% in the CBT group versus 54.2% in the chemotherapy group at 6 months, 61.1% versus 12.5% at 12 months, and 38.9% versus 4.2% at 18 months. The disease control rate was 68.0% in the CBT group and 29.8% in the chemotherapy group (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: These results from this retrospective analysis appeared to imply that CBT might prolong survival in these high-risk PC patients. Prospective study is needed to corroborate this observation.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Analytical morphometric assessment has recently been proposed to improve preoperative risk stratification. However, the relationship between body composition and outcomes following pancreaticoduodenectomy is still unclear. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of body composition on outcomes in patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy for cancer. METHODS: Body composition parameters including total abdominal muscle area (TAMA) and visceral fat area (VFA) were assessed by preoperative staging CT in patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy for cancer. Perioperative variables and postoperative outcomes (mortality or postoperative pancreatic fistula) were collected prospectively in the institutional pancreatic surgery database. Optimal stratification was used to determine the best cut-off values for anthropometric measures. Multivariable analysis was performed to identify independent predictors of 60-day mortality and pancreatic fistula. RESULTS: Of 202 included patients, 132 (65.3 per cent) were classified as sarcopenic. There were 12 postoperative deaths (5.9 per cent), major complications developed in 40 patients (19.8 per cent) and pancreatic fistula in 48 (23.8 per cent). In multivariable analysis, a VFA/TAMA ratio exceeding 3.2 and American Society of Anesthesiologists grade III were the strongest predictors of mortality (odds ratio (OR) 6.76 and 6.10 respectively; both P < 0.001). Among patients who developed major complications, survivors had a significantly lower VFA/TAMA ratio than non-survivors (P = 0.017). VFA was an independent predictor of pancreatic fistula (optimal cut-off 167 cm(2) : OR 4.05; P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Sarcopenia is common among patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy. The combination of visceral obesity and sarcopenia was the best predictor of postoperative death, whereas VFA was an independent predictor of pancreatic fistula.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Pancreatic cancers are thought to be unusually hypoxic, which might sensitize them to drugs that are activated under hypoxic conditions. In order to develop this idea in the clinic, a minimally invasive technique for measuring the oxygenation status of pancreatic cancers is needed. METHODS: We tested the potential for minimally invasive imaging of hypoxia in pancreatic cancer patients, using the 2-nitroimidazole PET tracer (18)F-fluoroazomycin arabinoside (or (18)F-1-alpha-D-[5-fluoro-5-deoxyarabinofuranosyl]-2-nitroimidazole [(18)F-FAZA]). Dynamic and static scans were obtained in 21 patients with either locally advanced or metastatic disease. The hypoxic fraction was determined in the 2-h static scans as the percentage of voxels with SUVs more than 3 SDs from the mean values obtained for skeletal muscle. RESULTS: Hypoxia was detected in 15 of 20 evaluable patients, with the hypoxic fraction ranging from less than 5% to greater than 50%. Compartmental analysis of the dynamic scans allowed us to approximate the tumor perfusion as mL/min/g of tissue, a value that is independent of the extent of hypoxia derived from tracer uptake in the 2-h static scan. There was no significant correlation between tumor perfusion and hypoxia; nor did we see an association between tumor volume and hypoxia. CONCLUSION: Although pancreatic cancers can be highly hypoxic, a substantial proportion appears to be well oxygenated. Therefore, we suggest that a minimally invasive technique such as the one described in this study be used for patient stratification in future clinical trials of hypoxia-targeting agents.',\n",

       "  'AB': \"The vast majority (85%) of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDACs) are discovered at too of a late stage to allow curative surgery. In addition, PDAC is highly resistant to conventional methods of chemotherapy and radiotherapy, which only offer a marginal clinical benefit. Consequently, the prognosis of this cancer is devastating, with a 5-year survival rate of less than 5%. In this dismal context, we recently demonstrated that PDAC gene therapy using nonviral vectors is safe and feasible, with early signs of efficacy in selected patients. Our next step is to transfer to the clinic HIV-1-based lentiviral vectors (LVs) that outshine other therapeutic vectors to treat experimental models of PDAC. However, a primary safety issue presented by LVs that may delay their use in patients is the risk of oncogenesis after vector integration in the host's cell DNA. Thus, we developed a novel anticancerous approach based on integrase-defective lentiviral vectors (IDLVs) and demonstrated that IDLVs can be successfully engineered to transiently deliver therapeutic genes to inhibit pancreatic cancer cells proliferation. This work stems for the use of therapeutic IDLVs for the management of PDAC, in forthcoming early phase gene therapy clinical trial for this disease with no cure.\",\n",

       "  'AB': 'The dire effects of cancer-induced cachexia undermine treatment and contribute to decreased survival rates. Therapeutic options for this syndrome are limited, and therefore efforts to identify signs of precachexia in cancer patients are necessary for early intervention. The applications of molecular and functional imaging that would enable a whole-body \"holistic\" approach to this problem may lead to new insights and advances for diagnosis and treatment of this syndrome. Here we have developed a myoblast optical reporter system with the purpose of identifying early cachectic events. We generated a myoblast cell line expressing a dual tdTomato:GFP construct that was grafted onto the muscle of mice-bearing human pancreatic cancer xenografts to provide noninvasive live imaging of events associated with cancer-induced cachexia (i.e., weight loss). Real-time optical imaging detected a strong tdTomato fluorescent signal from skeletal muscle grafts in mice with weight losses of only 1.2% to 2.7% and tumor burdens of only approximately 79 to 170 mm(3). Weight loss in cachectic animals was also associated with a depletion of lipid, cholesterol, valine, and alanine levels, which may provide informative biomarkers of cachexia. Taken together, our findings demonstrate the utility of a reporter system that is capable of tracking tumor-induced weight loss, an early marker of cachexia. Future studies incorporating resected tissue from human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma into a reporter-carrying mouse may be able to provide a risk assessment of cachexia, with possible implications for therapeutic development.',\n",

METHODS: Using information from personal interviews with 510 cases and 463 controls, we obtained adjusted odds ratios for weight loss, long-term and new-onset diabetes, fatigue, and depression before diagnosis. Among cases, we investigated the extent to which these factors occurred together and the characteristics of those reporting them. RESULTS: The adjusted odds ratio for weight loss (>3% of usual weight) was 27.0 (95% confidence interval, 17.1-42.6). Severe weight loss was common (21% of cases lost >15%), and was more common in those previously obese. Diabetes was more common in cases and was strongly associated with weight loss (P < 0.0001). Diabetes in cases more often led to prescription of insulin, compared with controls.Fatigue and depression were significantly more common in cases than controls but not related to weight loss or diabetes. These conditions were not related to stage at diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Weight loss, often severe, and new-onset diabetes frequently occur together before diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. Fatigue and depression are also potential precursors of diagnosis.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'OBJECTIVES: While pancreatic cancer (PC) most often affects older adults, to date, there has been no comprehensive assessment of risk factors among PC patients younger than 60 years. METHODS: We defined early-onset PC (EOPC) and very-early-onset PC (VEOPC) as diagnosis of PC in patients younger than 60 and 45 years, respectively. We pooled data from 8 case-control studies, including 1954 patients with EOPC and 3278 age- and sex-matched control subjects. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify associations with EOPC and VEOPC. RESULTS: Family history of PC, diabetes mellitus, smoking, obesity, and pancreatitis were associated with EOPC. Alcohol use equal to or greater than 26 g daily also was associated with increased risk of EOPC (odds ratio, 1.49; 95% confidence interval, 1.21-1.84), and there appeared to be a dose- and age-dependent effect of alcohol on risk. The point estimate for risk of VEOPC was an odds ratio of 2.18 (95% confidence interval, 1.17-4.09). CONCLUSIONS: The established risk factors for PC, including smoking, diabetes, family history of PC, and obesity, also apply to EOPC. Alcohol intake appeared to have an age-dependent effect; the strongest association was with VEOPC.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Clinical manifestations of pancreatic cancer often do not occur until the cancer has undergone metastasis, resulting in a very low survival rate. In this study, we investigated whether salivary bacterial profiles might provide useful biomarkers for early detection of pancreatic cancer. Using high-throughput sequencing of bacterial small subunit ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) gene, we characterized the salivary microbiota of patients with pancreatic cancer and compared them to healthy patients and patients with other diseases, including pancreatic disease, non-pancreatic digestive disease/cancer and non-digestive disease/cancer. A total of 146 patients were enrolled at the UCSD Moores Cancer Center where saliva and demographic data were collected from each patient. Of these, we analyzed the salivary microbiome of 108 patients: 8 had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, 78 with other diseases and 22 were classified as non-diseased (healthy) controls. Bacterial 16S rRNA sequences were amplified directly from salivary DNA extractions and subjected to high-throughput sequencing (HTS). Several bacterial genera differed in abundance in patients with pancreatic cancer. We found a significantly higher ratio of Leptotrichia to Porphyromonas in the saliva of patients with pancreatic cancer than in the saliva of healthy patients or those with other disease (Kruskal-Wallis Test; P < 0.001). Leptotrichia abundances were confirmed using real-time qPCR with Leptotrichia specific primers. Similar to previous studies, we found lower relative abundances of Neisseria and Aggregatibacter in the saliva of pancreatic cancer patients, though these results were not significant at the P < 0.05 level (K-W Test; P = 0.07 and P = 0.09 respectively). However, the relative abundances of other previously identified bacterial biomarkers, e.g., Streptococcus mitis and Granulicatella adiacens, were not significantly different in the saliva of pancreatic cancer patients. Overall, this study supports the hypothesis that bacteria abundance profiles in saliva are useful biomarkers for pancreatic cancer though much larger patient studies are needed to verify their predictive utility.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'PURPOSE: Chemoradiation therapy (CRT) for patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC) provides survival benefits but may result in considerable toxicity. Health-related quality of life (HRQL) measurements during CRT have not been widely reported. This paper reports HRQL data from the Selective Chemoradiation in Advanced Localised Pancreatic Cancer (SCALOP) trial, including validation of the QLQ-PAN26 tool in CRT. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients with locally advanced, inoperable, nonmetastatic carcinoma of the pancreas were eligible. Following 12 weeks of induction gemcitabine plus capecitabine (GEMCAP) chemotherapy, patients with stable and responding disease were randomized to a further cycle of GEMCAP followed by capecitabine- or gemcitabine-based CRT. HRQL was assessed with the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) and the EORTC Pancreatic Cancer module (PAN26). RESULTS: A total of 114 patients from 28 UK centers were registered and 74 patients randomized. There was improvement in the majority of HRQL scales during induction chemotherapy. Patients with significant deterioration in fatigue, appetite loss, and gastrointestinal symptoms during CRT recovered within 3 weeks following CRT. Differences in changes in HRQL scores between trial arms rarely reached statistical significance; however, where they did, they favored capecitabine therapy. PAN26 scales had good internal consistency and were able to distinguish between subgroups of patients experiencing toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: Although there is deterioration in HRQL following CRT, this resolves within 3 weeks. HRQL data support the use of capecitabine- over gemcitabine-based chemoradiation. The QLQ-PAN26 is a reliable and valid tool for use in patients receiving CRT.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the US. Cancer-associated cachexia is present in up to 80% of PDAC patients and is associated with aggressive disease and poor prognosis. In the present studies we evaluated an anti-cancer natural product silibinin for its effectiveness in targeting pancreatic cancer aggressiveness and the cachectic properties of pancreatic cancer cells and tumors. Our results demonstrate that silibinin inhibits pancreatic cancer cell growth in a dose-dependent manner and reduces glycolytic activity of cancer cells. Our LC-MS/MS based metabolomics data demonstrates that silibinin treatment induces global metabolic reprogramming in pancreatic cancer cells. Silibinin treatment diminishes c-MYC expression, a key regulator of cancer metabolism. Furthermore, we observed reduced STAT3 signaling in silibinin-treated cancer cells. Overexpression of constitutively active STAT3 was sufficient to substantially revert the silibinin-induced downregulation of c-MYC and the metabolic phenotype. Our in vivo investigations demonstrate that silibinin reduces tumor growth and proliferation in an orthotopic mouse model of pancreatic cancer and prevents the loss of body weight and muscle. It also improves physical activity including grip strength and latency to fall in tumor-bearing mice. In conclusion, silibinin-induced metabolic reprogramming diminishes cell growth and cachectic properties of pancreatic cancer cells and animal models.',\n",

Our previous work has shown that a high-fat, high-calorie diet (HFCD) leads to visceral obesity, pancreatic inflammation, and accelerated pancreatic neoplasia in KrasG12D (KC) mice. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of an HFCD on visceral adipose inflammation with emphasis on potential differences between distinct visceral adipose depots. METHODS: We examined the weight and visceral obesity in both wild-type and KC mice on either control diet (CD) or HFCD. After 3 months, mice were killed for histological examination. Multiplex assays were also performed to obtain cytokine profiles between different adipose depots. RESULTS: Both wild-type and KC mice on an HFCD exhibited significantly increased inflammation in the visceral adipose tissue, particularly in the peripancreatic fat (PPF), compared with animals on a CD. This was associated with significantly increased inflammation in the pancreas. Cytokine profiles were different between visceral adipose depots and between mice on the HFCD and CD. CONCLUSIONS: Our results clearly demonstrate that an HFCD leads to obesity and inflammation in the visceral adipose tissue, particularly the PPF. These data suggest that obesity-associated inflammation in PPF may accelerate pancreatic neoplasia in KC mice.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND & AIMS: Obesity is associated with an increased risk for pancreatic cancer, but it is unclear whether it affects mortality. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the association between premorbid obesity and mortality from pancreatic cancer. METHODS: We performed a systematic search through January 2015 and identified studies of the association between premorbid obesity (at least 1 year prior to pancreatic cancer diagnosis) and pancreatic cancer-related mortality. We estimated summary adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) with 95% confidence interval (CI), comparing data from obese (body mass index [BMI] >/=30 kg/m(2)) and overweight subjects (BMI, 25.0-29.9 kg/m(2)) with those from individuals with a normal BMI (controls) by using random-effects model. RESULTS: We identified 13 studies (including 3 studies that pooled multiple cohorts); 5 studies included only patients with pancreatic cancer, whereas 8 studies evaluated pancreatic cancer-related mortality in cancer-free individuals at inception. In the meta-analysis, we observed increase in pancreatic cancer-related mortality among overweight (aHR, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.02-1.11; I(2) = 0) and obese individuals (aHR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.20-1.42; I(2) = 43%), compared with controls; the association remained when we analyzed data from only subjects with pancreatic cancer. Each 1 kg/m(2) increase in BMI was associated with 10% increase in mortality (aHR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.05-1.15) with minimal heterogeneity (I(2) = 0). In the subgroup analysis, obesity was associated with increased mortality in Western populations (11 studies; aHR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.22-1.42) but not in Asia-Pacific populations (2 studies; aHR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.76-1.27). CONCLUSIONS: In a systematic review and meta-analysis, we associated increasing level of obesity with increased mortality in patients with pancreatic cancer in Western but not Asia-Pacific populations. Strategies to reduce obesity-induced metabolic abnormalities might be developed to treat patients with pancreatic cancer.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Stromal fibrosis and tissue necrosis are major histological sequelae of hypoxia. The hypoxia-to-fibrosis sequence is well-documented in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). However, hypoxic and necrotic PDAC phenotypes are insufficiently characterized. Recently, reduction of tuberous sclerosis expression in mice together with oncogenic Kras demonstrated a rapidly metastasizing phenotype with histologically eccentric necrosis, transitional hypoxia and devascularisation. We established cell lines from these tumors and transplanted them orthotopically into wild-type mice to test their abilities to recapitulate the histological features of the primary lesions. Notably, the necrotic phenotype was reproduced by only a subset of cell lines while others gave rise to dedifferentiated tumors with significantly reduced necrosis. In vitro analysis of the necrotic tumor-inducing cell lines revealed that these cells released a significant amount of vascular endothelial growth factor A (Vegfa). However, its release was not further increased under hypoxic conditions. Defective hypoxia-induced Vegfa secretion was not due to impaired Vegfa transcription or hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha activation, but rather a result of hypoxia-induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. We thus identified hypoxia-induced ER stress as an important pathway in PDACs with tissue necrosis and rapid metastasis.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Despite having one of the highest mortality rates of all cancers, the risk factors of pancreatic cancer remain unclear. We assessed risk factors of pancreatic cancer in China. METHODS: A case-control study design was conducted using data from four hospital-based cancer registries (Henan Provincial Cancer Hospital, Beijing Cancer Hospital, Hebei Provincial Cancer Hospital, and Cancer Hospital of Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences). Controls were equally matched and selected from family members of non-pancreatic cancer patients in the same hospitals. Face-to-face interviews were conducted by trained staff using questionnaires. Conditional logistic regression models were used to assess odd ratios (ORs) and 95% confident intervals (CIs). RESULTS: Among 646 recruited participants, 323 were pancreatic cancer patients and 323 were controls. Multivariate logistic analysis suggested that pancreatic cancer family history (adjusted OR 1.23; 95% CI, 1.11-3.70), obesity (adjusted OR 1.77; 95% CI, 1.22-2.57), diabetes (adjusted OR 2.96; 95% CI, 1.48-5.92) and smoking (adjusted OR 1.78; 95% CI, 1.02-3.10) were risk factors for pancreatic cancer, but that drinking tea (adjusted OR 0.49; 95% CI, 0.25-0.84) was associated with reduced risk of pancreatic cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Cigarette smoking, family history, obesity, and diabetes are risk factors of pancreatic cancer, which is important information for designing early intervention and preventive strategies for pancreatic cancer and may be beneficial to pancreatic cancer control in China.',\n",

We defined sarcopenia as a skeletal muscle index (SMI)< 42.2 cm2/m2 (male) and < 33.9 cm2/m2 (female) using ROC curve. RESULTS: Among 484 patients, 103 (21.3%) patients were sarcopenic at diagnosis. Decrease in SMI during chemotherapy was observed in 156 (60.9%) male and 65 (40.6%) female patients. Decrease in body mass index (BMI) was observed in 149 patients (37.3%), with no gender difference. By multivariate analysis, sarcopenia (P< 0.001), decreasedBMI and SMI during chemotherapy (P = 0.002, P = 0.004, respectively) were poor prognostic factors for overall survival (OS). While the OS of male patients was affected with sarcopenia (P< 0.001) and decreased SMI (P = 0.001), the OS of female patients was influenced with overweight at diagnosis (P = 0.006), decreased BMI (P = 0.032) and decreased SMI (P = 0.014). Particularly, while the change of BMI during chemotherapy did not have impact on OS within the patients with maintained SMI (P = 0.750), decrease in SMI was associated with poor OS within the patients with maintained BMI (HR 1.502; P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Sarcopenia at diagnosis and depletion of skeletal muscle, independent of BMI change, during chemotherapy were poor prognostic factors in advanced pancreatic cancer.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Body mass index (BMI), a measure of obesity typically assessed in middle age or later, is known to be positively associated with pancreatic cancer. However, little evidence exists regarding the influence of central adiposity, a high BMI during early adulthood, and weight gain after early adulthood on pancreatic cancer risk. DESIGN: We conducted a pooled analysis of individual-level data from 20 prospective cohort studies in the National Cancer Institute BMI and Mortality Cohort Consortium to examine the association of pancreatic cancer mortality with measures of central adiposity (e.g. waist circumference; n = 647 478; 1947 pancreatic cancer deaths), BMI during early adulthood (ages 18-21 years) and BMI change between early adulthood and cohort enrollment, mostly in middle age or later (n = 1 096 492; 3223 pancreatic cancer deaths). Multivariable hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using Cox proportional hazards regression models. RESULTS: Higher waist-to-hip ratio (HR = 1.09, 95% CI 1.02-1.17 per 0.1 increment) and waist circumference (HR = 1.07, 95% CI 1.00-1.14 per 10 cm) were associated with increased risk of pancreatic cancer mortality, even when adjusted for BMI at baseline. BMI during early adulthood was associated with increased pancreatic cancer mortality (HR = 1.18, 95% CI 1.11-1.25 per 5 kg/m(2)), with increased risk observed in both overweight and obese individuals (compared with BMI of 21.0 to <23 kg/m(2), HR = 1.36, 95% CI 1.20-1.55 for BMI 25.0 < 27.5 kg/m(2), HR = 1.48, 95% CI 1.20-1.84 for BMI 27.5 to <30 kg/m(2), HR = 1.43, 95% CI 1.11-1.85 for BMI >/=30 kg/m(2)). BMI gain after early adulthood, adjusted for early adult BMI, was less strongly associated with pancreatic cancer mortality (HR = 1.05, 95% CI 1.01-1.10 per 5 kg/m(2)). CONCLUSIONS: Our results support an association between pancreatic cancer mortality and central obesity, independent of BMI, and also suggest that being overweight or obese during early adulthood may be important in influencing pancreatic cancer mortality risk later in life.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'ABO blood type has previously been identified as a risk factor for thrombosis and pancreatic cancer (PC). The aim of the study is to demonstrate the associations between ABO blood type and other clinical factors with the risk of thromboembolism (TE) in patients with PC. We conducted a retrospective study in 670 patients with pathologically confirmed pancreatic adenocarcinoma at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. Clinical information was retrieved from medical records. ABO blood type was determined serologically and/or genetically. Logistic regression models, Kaplan-Meier plot, log-rank test, and Cox proportional hazard regression models were employed in data analysis. The incidence of TE was 35.2% in 670 patients who did not have TE prior to cancer diagnosis. Pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) consisted 44.1% of the TE events. Non-O blood type, pancreatic body/tail tumors, previous use of antithrombotic medication, and obesity (body mass index >30 kg/m(2) ) were significant predictors for TE in general. Blood type A and AB, low hemoglobin level (</= 10 g/dL), obesity, metastatic tumor, and pancreatic body/tail tumors were significant predictors for PE and DVT. Patients with metastatic tumor or pancreatic body/tail tumors had a much higher frequency of early TE events (</= 3 months after cancer diagnosis); and early TE occurrence was a significant independent predictor for increased risk of death. These observations suggest that ABO non-O blood type is an independent predictor for TE in PC. A better understanding of the risk factors for TE in PC may help to identify patients who are most likely to benefit from prophylactic anticoagulation therapy.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Recently, much attention has been paid to a potential biochemical cross-talk between the metabolism of the adipose tissue (AT) and bone (marrow), termed \"bone-fat axis.\" We hypothesized that selected substances, participating in this \"dialog,\" are associated with body mass and peripheral trafficking of bone marrow-derived stem cells (BMSCs) in both healthy individuals and patients with obesity-associated malignancies such as pancreatic adenocarcinoma.We performed an analysis of the systemic levels of selected substances involved in the regulation of bone (marrow) homeostasis (parathormone, calcitonin, osteopontin, osteonectin, stem cell factor [SCF], and fibroblast growth factor-23) in 35 generally healthy volunteers and 35 patients with pancreatic cancer. Results were correlated with the absolute number of circulating BMSCs and body mass values. Additionally, subcutaneous and visceral/omental AT levels of the aforementioned molecules were analyzed in lean and overweight/obese individuals.Intensified steady-state trafficking of only Lin-CD45 + CD133 + hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells was observed in overweight/obese individuals and this was associated with BMI values and elevated levels of both osteonectin and SCF, which also correlated with BMI. In comparison to healthy individuals, patients with cancer had significantly higher osteopontin levels and lower values of both osteonectin and osteonectin/osteopontin ratio. While no significant correlation was observed between BMI and the number of circulating BMSCs in patients with cancer, peripheral trafficking of CD34 + KDR + CD31 + CD45-endothelial progenitor cells and CD105 + STRO-1 + CD45-mesenchymal stem cells was associated with the osteonectin/osteopontin ratio, which also correlated with BMI (r = 0.52; P < 0.05). AT levels of the examined substances were similar to those measured in the plasma, except for osteonectin, which was about 10 times lower.Our study highlights the potential role of osteonectin, osteopontin, and SCF as communication signals between the bone (marrow) and AT in both healthy individuals and patients with pancreatic cancer. We postulate that these molecules may be overlooked biochemical players linking body mass and BMSCs with obesity-associated cancer development and/or progression in humans.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'AIM: To evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of stereotactic body radiotherapy using CyberKnife for locally advanced unresectable and metastatic pancreatic cancer. METHODS: From June 2010 to May 2014, 25 patients with locally advanced unresectable and metastatic pancreatic cancer underwent stereotactic body radiotherapy. Nine patients presented with unresectable locally advanced disease and 16 had metastatic disease. Primary end-points of this study were overall survival, relief of abdominal pain, and toxicity. RESULTS: Fourteen patients were treated with a total dose of 30-36 Gy in three fractions and the remainder with 40-48 Gy in four fractions. Median follow-up was 11 mo (range: 2-25 mo). The median survival duration calculated from the time of stereotactic body radiotherapy for the entire group, the locally advanced group, and the metastatic group was 9.0 mo, 13.5 mo, and 8.5 mo, respectively. Overall survival was 37% and 18% at one and two years, respectively. Abdominal pain relief was achieved within 2 wk of completing radiotherapy in the patients who received successful palliation (13 of 20 patients had significant pain). Five patients (20%) had grade 1 nausea, and one (4%) had grade 2 nausea. No acute grade 3+ toxicity was seen. CONCLUSION: Stereotactic body radiotherapy using the CyberKnife system is a promising, noninvasive, palliative treatment with acceptable toxicity for locally advanced unresectable and metastatic pancreatic cancer.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Cancer cachexia is a debilitating condition characterized by a combination of anorexia, muscle wasting, weight loss, and malnutrition. This condition affects an overwhelming majority of patients with pancreatic cancer and is a primary cause of cancer-related death. However, few, if any, effective therapies exist for both treatment and prevention of this syndrome. In order to develop novel therapeutic strategies for pancreatic cancer cachexia, appropriate animal models are necessary. In this study, we developed and validated a syngeneic, metastatic, murine model of pancreatic cancer cachexia. Using our model, we investigated the ability of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) blockade to mitigate the metabolic changes associated with cachexia. We found that TGF-beta inhibition using the anti-TGF-beta antibody 1D11.16.8 significantly improved overall mortality, weight loss, fat mass, lean body mass, bone mineral density, and skeletal muscle proteolysis in mice harboring advanced pancreatic cancer. Other immunotherapeutic strategies we employed were not effective. Collectively, we validated a simplified but useful model of pancreatic cancer cachexia to investigate immunologic treatment strategies. In addition, we showed that TGF-beta inhibition can decrease the metabolic changes associated with cancer cachexia and improve overall survival.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality. Despite significant advances made in the treatment of other cancers, current chemotherapies offer little survival benefit in this disease. Pancreaticoduodenectomy offers patients the possibility of a cure, but most will die of recurrent or metastatic disease. Hence, preventing metastatic disease in these patients would be of significant benefit. Using principal component analysis (PCA), we identified a LOX/hypoxia signature associated with poor patient survival in resectable patients. We found that LOX expression is upregulated in metastatic tumors from Pdx1-Cre Kras(G12D/+) Trp53(R172H/+) (KPC) mice and that inhibition of LOX in these mice suppressed metastasis. Mechanistically, LOX inhibition suppressed both migration and invasion of KPC cells. LOX inhibition also synergized with gemcitabine to kill tumors and significantly prolonged tumor-free survival in KPC mice with early-stage tumors. This was associated with stromal alterations, including increased vasculature and decreased fibrillar collagen, and increased infiltration of macrophages and neutrophils into tumors. Therefore, LOX inhibition is able to reverse many of the features that make PDAC inherently refractory to conventional therapies and targeting LOX could improve outcome in surgically resectable disease.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To investigate the feasibility and to determine the repeatability of recurrent [(18)F]HX4 PET scans in patients with oesophageal (EC) and pancreatic (PC) cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 32 patients were scanned in total; seven patients (4 EC/3 PC) were scanned 2, 3 and 4h post injection (PI) of [(18)F]HX4 and 25 patients (15 EC/10 PC) were scanned twice 3.5h PI, on two separate days (median 4, range 1-9days). Maximum tumour to background ratio (TBRmax) and the tumour hypoxic volume (HV) (TBR>1.0) were calculated. Repeatability was assessed using Bland-Altman analysis. Agreement in localization was calculated as the distance between the centres of mass in the HVs. RESULTS: For EC, the TBRmax in the tumour (mean+/-SD) was 1.87+/-0.46 with a coefficient of repeatability (CoR) of 0.53 (28% of mean). The HV ranged from 3.4 to 98.8ml with a CoR of 5.1ml. For PC, the TBRmax was 1.72+/-0.23 with a CoR of 0.27 (16% of mean). The HV ranged from 4.6 to 104.0ml with a CoR of 7.8ml. The distance between the centres of mass in the HV was 2.2+/-1.3mm for EC and 2.1+/-1.5mm for PC. CONCLUSIONS: PET scanning with [(18)F]HX4 was feasible in both EC and PC patients. Amount and location of elevated [(18)F]HX4 uptake showed good repeatability, suggesting [(18)F]HX4 PET could be a promising tool for radiation therapy planning and treatment response monitoring in EC and PC patients.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'The survival duration for pancreatic cancer is short. Given its low lifetime risk (1.5%), established factors for the disease have insufficient specificity to identify individuals at high risk of nonfamilial cancer, and prediagnostic signs and symptoms are vague and not limited to pancreatic causes. We considered whether statistical models that incorporated both risk factors and prediagnosis symptomatology could improve prediction enough to provide practical risk estimates. We combined US Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) incidence data from 2008 to 2010 with regression models from representative case-control data from Connecticut (2005-2009) to estimate age- and sex-specific 5-year absolute risks of pancreatic cancer diagnosis. Our risk model included current cigarette smoking (adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 3.3, 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.1, 5.0), current use of proton pump-inhibitor antiheartburn medications (OR = 6.2, 95% CI: 1.7, 23), recent diagnosis of diabetes mellitus (OR = 4.8, 95% CI: 2.2, 11), recent diagnosis of pancreatitis (OR = 19, 95% CI: 3.1, 120), Jewish ancestry (OR = 1.8, 95% CI: 1.1, 3.1), and ABO blood group other than O (OR = 1.3, 95% CI: 1.0, 1.8). In total, 0.87% of controls with combinations of these factors had estimated 5-year absolute risks greater than 5%, and for some, the risks reached more than 10%. Combining risk factors for pancreatic cancer with detectable prediagnostic symptomatology can allow investigators to begin to identify small segments of the population with risks sufficiently high enough to make screening efforts among them potentially useful.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Pancreatic cancer (PC) has been estimated to have higher incidence and correspondingly higher mortality rates in more developed regions worldwide. Overall, the age-adjusted incidence rate is 4.9/10(5) and age-adjusted mortality rate is at 4.8/10(5). We review here our current knowledge of modifiable risk factors (cigarette smoking, obesity, diet, and alcohol) for PC, genetic variants implicated by genome-wide association studies, possible genetic interactions with risk factors, and prevention strategies to provide future research directions that may further our understanding of this complex disease. Cigarette smoking is consistently associated with a two-fold increased PC risk. PC associations with dietary intake have been largely inconsistent, with the potential exception of certain unsaturated fatty acids decreasing risk and well-done red meat or meat mutagens increasing risk. There is strong evidence to support that obesity (and related measures) increase risk of PC. Only the heaviest alcohol drinkers seem to be at an increased risk of PC. Currently, key prevention strategies include avoiding tobacco and excessive alcohol consumption and adopting a healthy lifestyle. Screening technologies and PC chemoprevention are likely to become more sophisticated, but may only apply to those at high risk. Risk stratification may be improved by taking into account gene environment interactions. Research on these modifiable risk factors is key to reducing the incidence of PC and understanding who in the population can be considered high risk.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: The potential role of vitamin D in the aetiology of pancreatic cancer is unclear, with recent studies suggesting both positive and negative associations. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We used data from nine case-control studies from the International Pancreatic Cancer Case-Control Consortium (PanC4) to examine associations between pancreatic cancer risk and dietary vitamin D intake. Study-specific odds ratios (ORs) were estimated using multivariable logistic regression, and ORs were then pooled using a random-effects model. From a subset of four studies, we also calculated pooled estimates of association for supplementary and total vitamin D intake. RESULTS: Risk of pancreatic cancer increased with dietary intake of vitamin D [per 100 international units (IU)/day: OR = 1.13, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.07-1.19, P = 7.4 x 10(-6), P-heterogeneity = 0.52; >/=230 versus <110 IU/day: OR = 1.31, 95% CI 1.10-1.55, P = 2.4 x 10(-3), P-heterogeneity = 0.81], with the association possibly stronger in people with low retinol/vitamin A intake. CONCLUSION: Increased risk of pancreatic cancer was observed with higher levels of dietary vitamin D intake. Additional studies are required to determine whether or not our finding has a causal basis.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Obesity has been implicated as a significant risk factor for development of pancreatic cancer. In the setting of obesity, a systemic chronic inflammatory response is characterized by alterations in the production and secretion of a wide variety of growth factors. Leptin is a hormone whose level increases drastically in the serum of obese patients. High fat diet induced obesity in mice leads to an overall increased body weight, pancreatic weight, serum leptin, and pancreatic tissue leptin levels. Here we report the contribution of obesity and leptin to pancreatic cancer growth utilizing an in vivo orthotopic murine pancreatic cancer model, which resulted in increased tumor proliferation with concomitant increased tumor burden in the diet induced obese mice compared to lean mice. Human and murine pancreatic cancer cell lines were found to express the short as well as the long form of the leptin receptor and functionally responded to leptin induced activation through an increased phosphorylation of AKT473. In vitro, leptin stimulation increased cellular migration which was blocked by addition of a PI3K inhibitor. In vivo, depletion of the leptin receptor through shRNA knockdown partially abrogated increased orthotopic tumor growth in obese mice. These findings suggest that leptin contributes to pancreatic tumor growth through activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway, which promotes pancreatic tumor cell migration.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'PURPOSE: Lenalidomide have both immunomodulatory and anti-angiogenic properties which could confer anti-cancer effects. The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of combining lenalidomide with the standard treatment gemcitabine in pancreatic cancer patients with advanced disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligible patients had locally advanced or metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. Patients received lenalidomide days 1-21 orally and gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 intravenously (days 1, 8 and 15), each 28 day cycle. Three cohorts of lenalidomide were examined (Cohort I = 15 mg, Cohort II = 20 mg and Cohort III = 25 mg daily). The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of lenalidomide given in combination with gemcitabine was defined as the highest dose level at which no more than one out of four (25%) subjects experiences a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). Patients should also be able to receive daily low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) (e.g. dalteparin 5000 IU s.c. daily) as a prophylactic anticoagulant for venous thromboembolic events (VTEs). Twelve patients (n = 4, n = 3 and n = 5 in cohort I, II and III, respectively) were enrolled in this study. RESULTS: Median duration of treatment was 11 weeks (range 1-66), and median number of treatment cycles were three (range 1-14). The only DLT was a cardiac failure grade 3 in cohort III. Frequent treatment-related adverse events (AEs) (all grades) included neutropenia, leucopenia and fatigue (83% each, but there was no febrile neutropenia); thrombocytopenia (75%); dermatological toxicity (75%); diarrhea and nausea (42% each); and neuropathy (42%). DISCUSSION: This phase I study demonstrates the feasibility of the combination of lenalidomide and gemcitabine as first-line treatment in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. The tolerability profile demonstrated in the dose escalation schedule of lenalidomide suggests the dosing of lenalidomide to be 25 mg daily on days 1-21 with standard dosing of gemcitabine and merits further evaluation in a phase II trial.

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Skeletal muscle depletion, referred to as sarcopenia, is predictive of mortality in patients undergoing digestive operations. The impact of muscle quality on outcomes, however, is unclear. This retrospective study investigated the impact of preoperative skeletal muscle quantity and quality on survival in patients undergoing resection of pancreatic cancer. METHODS: We investigated 230 patients who underwent resection of pancreatic cancer between 2004 and 2013. The quantity and quality of skeletal muscle, indicated by psoas muscle mass index (PMI) and intramuscular adipose tissue content (IMAC), were measured in preoperative computed tomography images. Overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) rates were compared according to PMI and IMAC, and prognostic factors after pancreatic resection were assessed. RESULTS: The OS and RFS rates in patients with low PMI were lesser than in those with normal/high PMI (P < .001, P < .001), with a mean survival time of 17.7 and 33.2 months, respectively. The OS and RFS rates in patients with high IMAC also were less than in those with normal/low IMAC (P < .001, P = .003) (mean survival time = 21.5 and 56.5 months, respectively). Low PMI (low muscle mass) and high IMAC (low muscle quality) were independent prognostic factors of poor OS (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.999, P < .001; HR = 2.527, P < .001) and RFS (HR = 1.607, P = .007; HR = 1.640, P = .004), respectively. CONCLUSION: Preoperative sarcopenia, indicating low quality and quantity of skeletal muscle, is closely related to mortality after resection of pancreatic cancer.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis occurs very rarely in patients with pancreatic cancer. Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis is characterized by multifocal seeding of the leptomeninges by malignant cells that originate from a solid tumor. To the best of our knowledge, brain metastasis from pancreatic cancer is extremely rare. Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis is estimated to occur in 3% to 8% of cases of solid tumors. The clinical manifestation usually involves neurological symptoms, including dizziness, headache, vomiting, nausea, and hemiparesis, symptoms similar to those of meningitis or brain tumors. Diagnostic methods for leptomeningeal carcinomatosis include brain magnetic resonance imaging and cerebrospinal fluid examination. Here, we describe a case of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis in which the primary tumor was later determined to be pancreatic cancer. Brain magnetic resonance imaging findings showed mild enhancement of the leptomeninges, and cerebrospinal fluid cytology was negative at first. However, after repeated spinal taps, atypical cells were observed on cerebrospinal fluid analysis and levels of tumor markers such as carbohydrate antigen 19-9 in cerebrospinal fluid were elevated. Abdominal computed tomography, performed to determine the presence of extracerebral tumors, revealed pancreatic cancer. Pancreatic cancer was confirmed histopathologically on examination of an endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration specimen.',\n",

       "  'AB': \"Metformin treatment is associated with a decreased risk and better prognosis of pancreatic cancer (PC) in patients with type 2 diabetes, but the mechanism of metformin's PC growth inhibition in the context of a prediabetic state is unknown. We used a Panc02 pancreatic tumor cell transplant model in diet-induced obese (DIO) C57BL/6 mice to compare the effects of metformin and the direct mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor rapamycin on PC growth, glucose regulation, mTOR pathway signaling, and candidate microRNA (miR) expression. In DIO/prediabetic mice, metformin and rapamycin significantly reduced pancreatic tumor growth and mTOR-related signaling. The rapamycin effects centered on decreased mTOR-regulated growth and survival signaling, including increased expression of let-7b and cell cycle-regulating miRs. Metformin (but not rapamycin) reduced glucose and insulin levels and expression of miR-34a and its direct targets Notch, Slug, and Snail. Metformin also reduced the number and size of Panc02 tumor spheres in vitro and inhibited the expression of Notch in spheroids. Our results suggest that metformin and rapamycin can both inhibit pancreatic tumor growth in obese, prediabetic mice through shared and distinct mechanisms. Metformin and direct mTOR inhibitors, alone or possibly in combination, represent promising intervention strategies for breaking the diabetes-PC link.\",\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Little is known about changes in body composition that may occur during neoadjuvant therapy for pancreatic cancer. This study was designed to characterize these changes and their potential relationships with therapeutic outcomes. METHODS: The study population consisted of patients with potentially resectable pancreatic cancer treated on a phase II trial of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and chemoradiation. Skeletal muscle and adipose tissue compartments were measured before and after administration of neoadjuvant therapy using SliceOMatic software (TomoVision, 2012) and protocol-mandated CT scans. Sarcopenia was defined using gender-adjusted norms. RESULTS: Among 89 eligible patients, 46 (52 %) patients met anthropometric criteria for sarcopenia prior to the initiation of neoadjuvant therapy. Further depletion of skeletal muscle, visceral adipose tissue, and subcutaneous adipose tissue occurred during neoadjuvant therapy, but these losses did not preclude the performance of potentially curative surgery. Degree of skeletal muscle loss correlated with disease-free survival while visceral adipose loss was associated with overall and progression-free survival. However, completion of all therapy, including pancreatectomy, was the only independently significant predictor of outcome in a multivariate analysis of overall survival. DISCUSSION: These data suggest that body composition analysis of standard CT images may provide clinically relevant information for patients with potentially resectable pancreatic cancer who receive neoadjuvant therapy. Anthropometric changes must be considered in the design of preoperative therapy regimens, and further efforts should focus on maintenance of muscle and visceral adipose tissue in the preoperative setting.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'PURPOSE: Cancer cachexia is a multifactorial syndrome characterized by progressive loss of weight and muscle atrophy. Using metabolomics, we investigated serum markers and their intra-day variation in advanced pancreatic cancer patients with cachexia. METHODS: Patients were enrolled in two groups: those with or without cachexia. Blood samples collected at 6:30 AM, 11:30 AM, 4:30 PM, and 9:30 PM were analyzed using metabolomics, and serum levels of IL-6, TNF-alpha, and leptin were measured and compared between the two groups. Intra-day variation was then evaluated. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients were enrolled in total. In the cachexia group (n = 9), median body weight loss rate over 6 months was greater, performance status was poorer, and anorexia was more severe than in the non-cachexia group (n = 12). Each metabolites level showed substantial intra-day variation, and some of them displayed significant differences between the two groups. Levels of paraxanthine remained markedly lower in the cohort with cachexia at all measurement points. Besides, median IL-6 and TNF-alpha levels appeared higher and leptin concentration appeared lower in the cachexia group, albeit without statistical significance. CONCLUSION: Some metabolites and some serological marker levels were affected by cancer cachexia. Although paraxanthine levels were consistently lower in patients with cachexia, we identified that many metabolites indicated large intra- and inter-day variation and that it might be necessary to pay attention to intra-day variation in metabolomics research.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients have the highest risk of developing cachexia, which is a direct cause of reduced quality of life and shorter survival. Novel biomarkers to identify patients at risk of cachexia are needed and might have a substantial impact on clinical management. Here we investigated the prognostic value and association of SELP-rs6136, IL6-rs1800796 and AKT1-rs1130233 polymorphisms with cachexia in PDAC. Genotyping was performed in DNA from blood samples of a test and validation cohorts of 151 and 152 chemo-naive locally-advanced/metastatic PDAC patients, respectively. The association of SELP-rs6136, IL6-rs1800796 and AKT1-rs1130233 polymorphisms with cachexia as well as the correlation between cachexia and the candidate polymorphisms and overall survival were analyzed. Akt expression and phosphorylation in muscle biopsies were evaluated by specific ELISA assays. SELP-rs6136-AA and AKT1-rs1130233-AA/GA genotypes were associated with increased risk of developing cachexia in both cohorts (SELP: p = 0.011 and p = 0.045; AKT1: p = 0.004 and p = 0.019 for the first and second cohorts, respectively), while patients carrying AKT1-rs1130233-GG survived significantly longer (p = 0.002 and p = 0.004 for the first and second cohorts, respectively). In the multivariate analysis AKT1-rs1130233-AA/GA genotypes were significant predictors for shorter survival, with an increased risk of death of 1.7 (p = 0.002) and 1.6 (p = 0.004), in the first and second cohorts, respectively. This might be explained by the reduced phosphorylation of Akt1 in muscle biopsies from patients harboring AKT1-rs1130233-AA/GA (p = 0.003), favoring apoptosis induction. In conclusion, SELP and AKT1 polymorphisms may play a role in the risk of cachexia and death in PDAC patients, and should be further evaluated in larger prospective studies.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: The role of second-line therapy in metastatic pancreatic cancer is not clear. In this study, we aimed to explore the second-line efficiency of capecitabine and oxaliplatin (XELOX) in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer who have received gemcitabine-based first-line therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated 47 patients with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer previously treated with gemcitabine-based first-line regimens. Treatment consisted of oxaliplatin 130 mg/m2 and capecitabine 1000 mg/m2 twice daily with a 3 week interval, until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. RESULTS: Median number of cycles was 4 (range, 2-10). The overall disease control rate was 38.3%. The median overall survival and progression-free survival from the start of second-line therapy were 23 weeks (95%CI: 16.6-29.5 weeks) and 12 weeks (95%CI: 9.8-14.4 weeks), respectively. The most common grade 3-4 toxicities were nausea, vomiting and hematologic side effects. CONCLUSIONS: Our result suggests that the combination of capecitabine and oxaliplatin was tolerated with manageable toxicity and showed encouraging activity as second-line treatment of advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer patients with ECOG performance status 0-2.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PC) is the most deadly of the common cancers. Owing to its rapid progression and almost certain fatal outcome, identifying individuals at risk and detecting early lesions are crucial to improve outcome. Genetic risk factors are believed to play a major role. Approximately 10% of PC is estimated to have familial inheritance. Several germline mutations have been found to be involved in hereditary forms of PC, including both familial PC (FPC) and PC as one of the manifestations of a hereditary cancer syndrome or other hereditary conditions. Although most of the susceptibility genes for FPC have yet to be identified, next-generation sequencing studies are likely to provide important insights. The risk of PC in FPC is sufficiently high to recommend screening of high-risk individuals; thus, defining such individuals appropriately is the key. Candidate genes have been described and patients considered for screening programs under research protocols should first be tested for presence of germline mutations in the BRCA2, PALB2 and ATM genes. In specific PC populations, including in Italy, hereditary cancer predisposition genes such as CDKN2A also explain a considerable fraction of FPC.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: The treatment of cancer patients with mistletoe extract is said to prolong their survival and, above all, improve their quality of life. We studied whether the quality of life of patients with advanced pancreatic cancer could be improved by mistletoe extract. METHOD: An open, single-center, group-sequential, randomized phase III trial (ISRCTN70760582) was conducted. From January 2009 to December 2010, 220 patients with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer who were receiving no further treatment for pancreatic cancer other than best supportive care were included in this trial. They were stratified by prognosis and randomly allocated either to a group that received mistletoe treatment or to one that did not. Mistletoe extract was given in escalating doses by subcutaneous injection three times a week. The planned interim evaluation of data from 220 patients indicated that mistletoe treatment was associated with longer overall survival, and the trial was terminated prematurely. After termination of the study, the results with respect to quality of life (assessed with the QLO-C30 scales of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer) and trends in body weight were evaluated. RESULTS: Data on quality of life and body weight were obtained from 96 patients treated with mistletoe and 72 control patients. Those treated with mistletoe did better on all 6 functional scales and on 7 of 9 symptom scales, including pain (95% confidence interval [CI] -29 to -17), fatigue (95% CI -36.1 to -25.0), appetite loss (95% CI -51 to -36.7), and insomnia (95% CI -45.8 to -28.6). This is reflected by the trend in body weight during the trial. CONCLUSION: In patients with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic carcinoma, mistletoe treatment significantly improves the quality of life in comparison to best supportive care alone. Mistletoe is an effective second-line treatment for this disease.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'In traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), diagnosis and prescriptions are based on the signs and symptoms which are recognized as ZHENG. The cornerstone of TCM is to differentially treat one ZHENG from others, which is also known as syndrome differentiation, and this relies on the gathering of clinical information through inspection, auscultation and olfaction, inquiry, and palpation. However, the biomolecular basis of the ZHENG remains unclear. In this study, the expressions of 384 cancer-related miRNAs in salivary supernatant of patients with pancreatic cancer were assessed by miRNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) array, and the different expression patterns of miRNA in three different groups of ZHENG were studied with use of real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR). Some miRNAs were found to be specifically expressed in some ZHENGs, for instance, miR-17, miR-21, and miR-181b in Shi-Re ZHENG and miR-196a in Pi-Xu ZHENG. This indicates that these miRNAs may play important roles in different ZHENG condition. Therefore, this study to some extent revealed the molecular basis of TCM ZHENG in pancreatic cancer.',\n",

       "  'AB': \"In clinically aggressive diseases, patients experience pathophysiological changes that often alter concentrations of lipids and environmental lipophilic factors; such changes are related to disease signs and symptoms. The aim of the study was to compare the effects of correcting for total serum lipids (TSL) and other clinical factors on the odds of mutations in the K-ras oncogene by organochlorine compounds (OCs), in logistic models, in 103 patients with exocrine pancreatic cancer (EPC) using a causal directed acyclic graph (DAG) framework. Results and likelihood of bias were discussed in the light of possible causal scenarios. The odds of K-ras mutated EPC was associated with some TSL-corrected OCs, including p,p'-DDT (p-value: 0.008) and polychlorinated biphenyl 138 (p-trend: 0.024). When OCs were not corrected by TSL, the OR of a K-ras mutation was significant for p,p'-DDT (p-trend: 0.035). Additionally adjusting for cholestatic syndrome increased the ORs of TSL-corrected OCs. When models were adjusted by the interval from first symptom to blood extraction (ISE), the ORs increased for both TSL-corrected and uncorrected OCs. Models with TSL-corrected OCs and adjusted for cholestatic syndrome or ISE yielded the highest ORs. We show that DAGs clarify the covariates necessary to minimize bias, and demonstrate scenarios under which adjustment for TSL-corrected OCs and failure to adjust for symptoms or ISE may induce bias. Models with TSL-uncorrected OCs may be biased too, and adjusting by symptoms or ISE may not control such biases. Our findings may have implications as well for studying environmental causes of other clinically aggressive diseases.\",\n",

During the ASCO Annual Meeting 2014, one abstract focusing on cancer-cachexia syndrome (Abstract #15208) emphasized the fact that cachexia is under diagnosed even in patients with pancreatic cancer who constitute a high-risk group for presenting this syndrome. In addition the abstract raises concerns about the benefit of the use of dronabinol and megestrol acetate in treating the cachexia syndrome in this group of patients. Another important factor that determines QOL in pancreatic cancer patients is surgical procedures-pancreatectomies that these patients may undergo. A very interesting abstract presented also at the ASCO Annual Meeting 2014 (Abstract #15234) explores the benefit of using pasireotide perioperative in ameliorating QOL of patients who had surgical intervention.',\n",

       "  'AB': \"Cachexia is frequently described in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and is associated with reduced survival and quality of life. Unfortunately, the therapeutic options of this multi-factorial and complex syndrome are limited. This is due to the fact that, despite extensive preclinical and clinical research, the underlying pathological mechanisms leading to PDAC-associated cachexia are still not fully understood. Furthermore, there is still a lack of consensus on the definition of cachexia, which complicates the standardization of diagnosis and treatment as well as the analysis of the current literature. In order to provide an efficient therapy for cachexia, an early and reliable diagnosis and consistent monitoring is required, which can be challenging especially in obese patients. Although many substances have been tested in clinical and preclinical settings, so far none of them have been proven to have a long-term effect in ameliorating cancer-associated cachexia. However, recent studies have demonstrated that multidimensional therapeutic modalities are able to alleviate pancreatic cancer-associated cachexia and ultimately improve patients' outcome. In this current review, we propose a stepwise and pragmatic approach to facilitate and standardize the treatment of cachexia in pancreatic cancer patients. This strategy consists of nutritional, dietary, pharmacological, physical and psychological methods.\",\n",

Cox regression was used to calculate HRs and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for levels of BMI relative to BMI 18.5-24.9, with adjustment for covariates. Primary analyses were restricted to participants with >/=5 years of follow-up because weight loss before diagnosis may have influenced baseline BMI in cases who died during early follow-up. RESULTS: In follow-up of 239,597 participants, 897 pancreatic cancer deaths occurred. HRs were 1.08 (95% CI, 0.90-1.31) for BMI 25.0 to 29.9, 1.25 (95% CI, 0.99-1.57) for BMI 30.0 to 34.9, and 1.31 (95% CI, 0.97-1.77) for BMI >/=35.0 among those with >/=5 years of follow-up (Ptrend = 0.03). The association was evident among both sexes and was independent of a history of diabetes. A stronger association was observed among never-smokers (BMI >/=30 vs. referent: HR = 1.44; 95% CI, 1.02-2.03) than among smokers (HR = 1.16; 95% CI, 0.87-1.54; Pinteraction = 0.02). CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that obesity is independently associated with increased pancreatic cancer mortality in African Americans. IMPACT: Interventions to reduce obesity may also reduce risk of pancreatic cancer mortality, particularly among never-smokers.',\n",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of thoracoscopic unilateral left splanchnicectomy for pain control in a first series of 15 patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifteen patients suffering from intractable pain due to unresectable pancreatic cancer (stage III and IV)underwent thoracoscopic unilateral left splanchnicectomy. To assess pain severity and the impact of this palliative procedure for pain relief, all patients completed Wong-Baker Faces Pain Rating Scale with a preoperative pain degree between 7 and 9. RESULTS: Surgical intervention duration varied from 30 minutes to 1 hour. Pleural drainage tube was removed 24 hours postoperatively.There were no complications nor deaths.Immediate pain relief (pain degree 0-2) was achieved in all patients after thoracoscopic unilateral splanchnicectomy, same level being registered at first check-up after one month. CONCLUSIONS: Thoracoscopic unilateral left splanchnicectomy decreases the pain substantially and significantly improves the quality of life in patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of sequential or simultaneous telomerase vaccination (GV1001) in combination with chemotherapy in patients with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer. METHODS: TeloVac was a three-group, open-label, randomised phase 3 trial. We recruited patients from 51 UK hospitals. Eligible patients were treatment naive, aged older than 18 years, with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive either chemotherapy alone, chemotherapy with sequential GV1001 (sequential chemoimmunotherapy), or chemotherapy with concurrent GV1001 (concurrent chemoimmunotherapy). Treatments were allocated with equal probability by means of computer-generated random permuted blocks of sizes 3 and 6 in equal proportion. Chemotherapy included six cycles of gemcitabine (1000 mg/m(2), 30 min intravenous infusion, at days 1, 8, and 15) and capecitabine (830 mg/m(2) orally twice daily for 21 days, repeated every 28 days). Sequential chemoimmunotherapy included two cycles of combination chemotherapy, then an intradermal lower abdominal injection of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF; 75 mug) and GV1001 (0.56 mg; days 1, 3, and 5, once on weeks 2-4, and six monthly thereafter). Concurrent chemoimmunotherapy included giving GV1001 from the start of chemotherapy with GM-CSF as an adjuvant. The primary endpoint was overall survival; analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered as an International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial, number ISRCTN4382138. FINDINGS: The first patient was randomly assigned to treatment on March 29, 2007, and the trial was terminated on March 27, 2011. Of 1572 patients screened, 1062 were randomly assigned to treatment (358 patients were allocated to the chemotherapy group, 350 to the sequential chemoimmunotherapy group, and 354 to the concurrent chemoimmunotherapy group). We recorded 772 deaths; the 290 patients still alive were followed up for a median of 6.0 months (IQR 2.4-12.2). Median overall survival was not significantly different in the chemotherapy group than in the sequential chemoimmunotherapy group (7.9 months [95% CI 7.1-8.8] vs 6.9 months [6.4-7.6]; hazard ratio [HR] 1.19, 98.25% CI 0.97-1.48, p=0.05), or in the concurrent chemoimmunotherapy group (8.4 months [95% CI 7.3-9.7], HR 1.05, 98.25% CI 0.85-1.29, p=0.64; overall log-rank of chi(2)2df=4.3; p=0.11). The commonest grade 3-4 toxic effects were neutropenia (68 [19%] patients in the chemotherapy group, 58 [17%] patients in the sequential chemoimmunotherapy group, and 79 [22%] patients in the concurrent chemoimmunotherapy group; fatigue (27 [8%] in the chemotherapy group, 35 [10%] in the sequential chemoimmunotherapy group, and 44 [12%] in the concurrent chemoimmunotherapy group); and pain (34 [9%] patients in the chemotherapy group, 39 [11%] in the sequential chemoimmunotherapy group, and 41 [12%] in the concurrent chemoimmunotherapy group). INTERPRETATION: Adding GV1001 vaccination to chemotherapy did not improve overall survival. New strategies to enhance the immune response effect of telomerase vaccination during chemotherapy are required for clinical efficacy. FUNDING: Cancer Research UK and KAEL-GemVax.',\n",

       "  'AB': \"Persistent pain is a serious problem that often contributes to a poor quality of life in pancreatic cancer patients. Medical management by opioid analgesics is often accompanied by side effects and incomplete pain relief. A celiac plexus block is a simple treatment which relieves pain, but the procedure demands a certain degree of proficiency and the duration of the effects obtained can be rather limited. Transhiatal bilateral splanchnicectomy achieves a certain denervation of splanchnic nerves, but it requires a laparotomy. Unilateral thoracoscopic splanchnicectomy is a minimally invasive procedure to cause definite denervation. Bilateral thoracoscopic splanchnicectomy is recommended for unsatisfactory cases or recurrent pain occurring after the initial unilateral splanchnicectomy. It is important to select the most suitable treatment depending on patients' actual medical state and the predicted outcomes.\",\n",

       "  'AB': 'OBJECTIVES: The primary objective was to determine the response rate in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer treated in first line with irinotecan/docetaxel combination (Arm A) or with irinotecan/docetaxel/cetuximab combination (Arm B). Secondary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), toxicity, and the rate of thromboembolic events with prophylactic enoxaparin sodium. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were eligible who had measurable, metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas, and normal bilirubin. All patients received anticoagulation. Docetaxel (35 mg/m) and irinotecan (50 mg/m) were administered once a week for 4 weeks followed by 2 weeks rest (Arm A) alone or with the addition of cetuximab (Arm B). The primary endpoint was response rate. RESULTS: A total of 87 eligible patients were enrolled and treated. Grade 3/4 toxicity was observed in 74% of patients in Arm A and 76% in Arm B. The principal grade 3/4 toxicity was diarrhea. Response rates were 4.5% in Arm A and 7% in Arm B. Median PFS and OS were 3.9 and 6.5 months in Arm A and 4.5 and 5.4 months in Arm B. CONCLUSIONS: Docetaxel/irinotecan combination is associated with considerable toxicity. Objective responses were infrequent and addition of cetuximab in an unselected population was not beneficial, but PFS and OS were comparable with those achieved with other regimens. Docetaxel/irinotecan therapy is active in metastatic pancreatic cancer.',\n",

       "  'AB': \"OBJECTIVES: Clinical benefit response (CBR), based on changes in pain, Karnofsky performance status, and weight, is an established palliative endpoint in trials for advanced gastrointestinal cancer. We investigated whether CBR is associated with survival, and whether CBR reflects a wide-enough range of domains to adequately capture patients' perception. METHODS: CBR was prospectively evaluated in an international phase III chemotherapy trial in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer (n = 311) in parallel with patient-reported outcomes (PROs). RESULTS: The median time to treatment failure was 3.4 months (range: 0-6). The majority of the CBRs (n = 39) were noted in patients who received chemotherapy for at least 5 months. Patients with CBR (n = 62) had longer survival than non-responders (n = 182) (hazard ratio = 0.69; 95% confidence interval: 0.51-0.94; p = 0.013). CBR was predicted with a sensitivity and specificity of 77-80% by various combinations of 3 mainly physical PROs. A comparison between the duration of CBR (n = 62, median = 8 months, range = 4-31) and clinically meaningful improvements in the PROs (n = 100-116; medians = 9-11 months, range = 4-24) showed similar intervals. CONCLUSION: CBR is associated with survival and mainly reflects physical domains. Within phase III chemotherapy trials for advanced gastrointestinal cancer, CBR can be replaced by a PRO evaluation, without losing substantial information but gaining complementary information.\",\n",

Pain is common in pancreatic cancer patients with 70%-80% suffering substantial pain. Celiac plexus neurolysis (CPN) is a technique that can potentially improve pain control in pancreatic cancer while preventing further escalation of opioid consumption. CPN is performed by injecting absolute alcohol into the celiac plexus neural network of ganglia. This review sets out to explore the current status of CPN in non-resectable pancreatic cancer. We will examine: (1) the efficacy and safety of percutaneous-CPN and endoscopic ultrasound guided-CPN; (2) specific technique modifications including bilateral (vs central) injections and celiac ganglia neurolysis; and (3) the issue of CPN timing, early at pancreatic cancer diagnosis vs traditional late use as salvage therapy.',\n",

       "  'AB': \"OBJECTIVE: This article explores how people with pancreatic cancer interpreted prediagnostic signs and symptoms, and what triggered them to seek medical help for symptoms that occurred intermittently. DESIGN: Thematic analysis of prediagnostic symptom descriptions drawn from a qualitative interview study of people with experiences of pancreatic cancer. PARTICIPANTS: 40 people affected by pancreatic cancer (32 patients and 8 relatives of people who had died). Age at interview ranged from 35 to 84 years; 55% were men; and 57.5% of patients had been offered potentially curative surgery. SETTING: Respondents interviewed at home were recruited from different parts of the UK during 2009/2010. RESULTS: Analysis of the interviews suggested that intermittent symptoms were not uncommon in the months, or even years, before diagnosis but that the fact that the symptom did not persist was often taken by the patient as a reassuring indicator that it could not be 'very important'. Such symptoms were rarely acted upon until a pattern became apparent, the frequency of symptom episodes increased, there was a change in the nature of the intermittent symptoms or additional symptom(s) appeared. These findings build on social science theories of consultation behaviour. CONCLUSIONS: Our study-the largest reported collection of qualitative interviews with people with pancreatic cancer-reports for the first time that symptoms of an intermittent nature may precede a pancreatic cancer diagnosis. Patients (and potentially their doctors as well) may be falsely reassured by symptoms that come and go. Pancreatic cancer might be identified at a stage where curative treatment is more likely if there were greater awareness that intermittent gastrointestinal symptoms can have a serious cause, and if patients with intermittent pancreatitis-like symptoms were investigated more readily.\",\n",

       "  'AB': 'Pain in pancreatic cancer is often a major problem of treatment. Administration of opioids is frequently limited by side effects or insufficient analgesia. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided celiac plexus neurolysis (EUS-CPN) represents an alternative for the palliative treatment of visceral pain in patients with pancreatic cancer. This review focuses on the indications, technique, outcomes of EUS-CPN and predictors of pain relief. EUS-CPN should be considered as the adjunct method to standard pain management. It moderately reduces pain in pancreatic cancer, without eliminating it. Nearly all patients need to continue opioid use, often at a constant dose. The effect on quality of life is controversial and survival is not influenced. The approach could be done in the central position of the celiac axis, which is easy to perform, or in the bilateral position of the celiac axis, with similar results in terms of pain alleviation. The EUS-CPN with multiple intraganglia injection approach seems to have better results, although extended studies are still needed. Further trials are required to enable more confident conclusions regarding timing, quantity of alcohol injected and the method of choice. Severe complications have rarely been reported, and great care should be taken in choosing the site of alcohol injection.',\n",

       "  'AB': \"CONTEXT: High body mass index (BMI) is linked to an increased risk of developing pancreatic cancer (PC). However, in patients with advanced PC (APC), especially those receiving palliative chemotherapy, the impact of BMI on survival has not been investigated fully. OBJECTIVES: To assess changes in BMI during the course of APC and their impact on patient survival, specifically for those receiving palliative chemotherapy. METHODS: Consecutive patients with APC, all of whom were treated with palliative chemotherapy, were enrolled during 2003-2010. Clinical characteristics and prognoses were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 425 patients participated (median age, 60.1 years). At diagnosis of APC, patients' BMI distribution of patients was as follow: <18.5 (45, 10.6%); 18.5-19.9 (67, 15.8%); 20.0-22.4 (156, 36.7%); 22.5-24.9 (107, 25.2%); 25.0-29.9 (49, 11.5%); and >/= 30.0 (1, 0.2%). Median overall survival (OS) was 8.1 months (95% confidence interval 7.2, 9.1). Precancer BMI and baseline BMI (at diagnosis) had no impact on OS. Weight loss at diagnosis (precancer weight minus weight at diagnosis) and weight loss during first-line chemotherapy (both stipulated as BMI change >/= 1) were associated with shortened OS (hazard ratio, 1.300; P = 0.012 and hazard ratio, 1.367; P = 0.010, respectively). CONCLUSION: In patients with APC undergoing palliative chemotherapy, decreases in BMI at APC diagnosis and during chemotherapy are more hazardous for OS than precancer BMI or baseline BMI (at diagnosis) as absolute values. Further studies are needed to validate this finding and investigate strategies to maintain BMI during chemotherapy in this setting.\",\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Solid pseudopapillary tumor (SPT) of the pancreas, also known as Franz tumor, Hamoudie tumor, solid-cystic-papillary epithelial neoplasm, or solid and cystic tumor, is a neoplasm of transitory (potential) malignancy, seen predominantly in young women. CASE REPORT: This report presents a female patient treated for a solid pseudopapillary tumor of the pancreas with hepatic metastases. The tumor was first diagnosed in 2006. Non-specific abdominal pain was the first presenting symptom. The patient underwent distal pancreatic resection and splenectomy in July 2006. Multifocal metastatic disease seen at surgery precluded radical resection. Following definitive pathology confirmation and the exclusion of extrahepatic metastases, the patient was referred to our transplant centre 18 months after pancreatic surgery, to be considered for orthotopic liver transplantation (OLTx). The extent of the disease was once again evaluated by imaging studies, followed by exploratory laparotomy. The patient underwent cadaveric liver transplantation in March 2008, with triple immunosuppression (tacrolimus, MMF, and steroids) following surgery. Presently, more than 5 years post-transplant, the patient has no signs of recurrent neoplasmatic disease. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first liver transplantation for a metastatic pancreatic pseudopapillary tumor in Poland, with the longest follow-up period described in the literature. Follow-up suggests a cautiously optimistic prognosis despite primary unresectability of hepatic metastases and the necessity for immunosuppressive therapy.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'For patients with pancreatic cancer who suffer from obstructive jaundice, percutaneous transhepatic cholangiodrainage (PTCD) is the treatment of choice. However, there are no standards for palliative care for patients undergoing this treatment. The aim of this study was to retrospectively evaluate the efficacy of post-palliative treatment in patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer who were previously treated with PTCD. The 47 patients included in this study had unresectable pancreatic cancer, presented with obstructive jaundice, had no prior history of chemotherapy, and underwent PTCD. They were divided into two groups. Group A was composed of 21 patients who received post-palliative treatment (chemotherapy, radiation, or chemoradiotherapy). Group B consisted of 26 patients who were under best supportive care (BSC). We compared the median overall survival time between the two groups to evaluate the efficacy of post-palliative treatment. The median overall survival time (MOST) of patients undergoing PTCD was 7.19 months. MOST was 9.07 months for patients in group A (P = 0.017 vs. group B) and 5.52 months for those in group B. Among the patients receiving post-palliative treatment, 12 (57% of patients) received only a single therapy (either chemo or radiation), and 9 (43%) received chemoradiotherapy. Their median overall survival times were 8.31 and 11.15 months, respectively (P = 0.325). Post-palliative treatment in patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer previously treated with PTCD is more effective than only best supportive care alone. Patients receiving both chemo and radiation may benefit more in terms of overall survival compared to patients receiving only one or the other.',\n",

       "  'AB': \"CONTEXT: Oxaliplatin, a third-generation platinum derivative is commonly used for the treatment of colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, upper gastrointestinal cancer, hepatobiliary cancer, and ovarian cancer. Neurotoxicity is the dose limiting toxicity and ototoxicity is very rare, less than 1% of patients. CASE REPORT: We present a case of a female patient with locally advanced unresectable pancreatic cancer who developed hearing loss after receiving oxaliplatin and gemcitabine. The dose of oxaliplatin was reduced but continued due to clinical benefit and radiological response. DISCUSSION: To the best of our knowledge, this is the third case report of oxaliplatin-induced ototoxicity. Ototoxicity seems to be a rare complication of oxaliplatin therapy. Regardless of its rare occurrence, clinicians should be aware of this severe complication and be diligent in monitoring patients's clinical symptoms.\",\n",

       "  'AB': 'PURPOSE: Although obesity is associated with increased incidence of pancreatic cancer, studies have not prospectively evaluated prediagnostic body mass index (BMI) and survival. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed survival by prediagnostic BMI assessed in 1986 among 902 patients from two large prospective cohorts diagnosed from 1988 to 2010. We estimated hazard ratios (HRs) for death using Cox proportional hazards models, with adjustment for age, sex, race/ethnicity, smoking, diagnosis year, and stage. We evaluated the temporal association of BMI with survival by grouping reported BMI by 2-year lag-time intervals before diagnosis. RESULTS: The multivariable-adjusted HR for death was 1.53 (95% CI, 1.11 to 2.09) comparing patients with BMI >/= 35 kg/m(2) with those with BMI < 25 kg/m(2) (P trend = .001), which was similar after adjustment for stage. The association of BMI with survival was stronger with longer lag times between reported BMI and cancer diagnosis. Among patients with BMI collected 18 to 20 years before diagnosis, HR for death was 2.31 (95% CI, 1.48 to 3.61; P trend < .001), comparing obese with healthy-weight patients. No statistically significant differences were seen by cohort, smoking status, or stage, although the association was stronger among never-smokers (HR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.01 to 2.57; P trend = .002) than ever-smokers (HR, 1.36; 95% CI, 0.86 to 2.15; P trend = .63), comparing BMI >/= 35 kg/m(2) with BMI < 25 kg/m(2). Higher prediagnostic BMI was associated with more advanced stage at diagnosis, with 72.5% of obese patients presenting with metastatic disease versus 59.4% of healthy-weight patients (P = .02). CONCLUSION: Higher prediagnostic BMI was associated with statistically significantly decreased survival among patients with pancreatic cancer from two large prospective cohorts.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Obesity and diabetes are potentially alterable risk factors for pancreatic cancer. Genetic factors that modify the associations of obesity and diabetes with pancreatic cancer have previously not been examined at the genome-wide level. METHODS: Using genome-wide association studies (GWAS) genotype and risk factor data from the Pancreatic Cancer Case Control Consortium, we conducted a discovery study of 2,028 cases and 2,109 controls to examine gene-obesity and gene-diabetes interactions in relation to pancreatic cancer risk by using the likelihood-ratio test nested in logistic regression models and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). RESULTS: After adjusting for multiple comparisons, a significant interaction of the chemokine signaling pathway with obesity (P = 3.29 x 10(-6)) and a near significant interaction of calcium signaling pathway with diabetes (P = 1.57 x 10(-4)) in modifying the risk of pancreatic cancer were observed. These findings were supported by results from IPA analysis of the top genes with nominal interactions. The major contributing genes to the two top pathways include GNGT2, RELA, TIAM1, and GNAS. None of the individual genes or single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) except one SNP remained significant after adjusting for multiple testing. Notably, SNP rs10818684 of the PTGS1 gene showed an interaction with diabetes (P = 7.91 x 10(-7)) at a false discovery rate of 6%. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic variations in inflammatory response and insulin resistance may affect the risk of obesity- and diabetes-related pancreatic cancer. These observations should be replicated in additional large datasets. IMPACT: A gene-environment interaction analysis may provide new insights into the genetic susceptibility and molecular mechanisms of obesity- and diabetes-related pancreatic cancer.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to examine the relationships between cytokines, depression, and pancreatic cancer. METHOD: A total of 75 individuals were recruited from two New York City hospitals (a cancer center and a psychiatric hospital) and composed of four subgroups: patients with adenocarcinoma of the pancreas who did (n = 17) and did not (n = 26) have a diagnosis of Major Depressive Episode (MDE), and healthy participants with (n = 7) and without (n = 25) MDE. All individuals completed a battery of self-report measures. Sera was assayed using Meso Scale Discovery techniques to measure the following pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines: IL-1beta, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12p70, IFN-gamma, TGF-beta, and TNF-alpha; we also calculated the IL-2/IL-4 ratio. RESULTS: Pancreatic cancer patients had significantly higher levels of IL-6 and IL-10 and significantly lower TGF-beta levels than healthy participants. When the sample was divided into those with and without MDE, the groups only differed with regard to serum IL-6 levels. No significant cancer and depression interaction effect was observed. Severity of depressive symptoms was also significantly correlated with IL-6, rs = 0.28 and p = 0.02, whereas hopelessness was associated with IFN-alpha, rs  = 0.34 and p = 0.006. Pain, fatigue, and sleep disturbance were associated with several of the cytokines assayed including IL-1beta (pain intensity), IL-4 (pain intensity and overall sleep quality), IL-12p70 (pain intensity), and TGF-beta (fatigue intensity), but anxiety was not associated with any of the cytokines assayed. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated an association between depression and IL-6, but not with other cytokines. Moreover, IL-6 was not significantly associated with other measures of psychological distress (anxiety and hopelessness) or with symptom distress (pain, fatigue, and sleep quality), although some cytokines assayed were associated with specific symptoms. The implications of these findings for the etiology and treatment of depression in pancreatic cancer patients are discussed.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: The association of excess body weight across a lifetime with pancreatic cancer has not been examined extensively. OBJECTIVE: We determined the association for body mass index (BMI) at different ages and adiposity duration and gain with incident pancreatic adenocarcinoma in the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study cohort. DESIGN: Participants aged 50-71 y completed questionnaires at baseline (1995-1996) and 6 months later that queried height and weight history. We calculated HRs and 95% CIs by using Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for age, smoking, sex, and intakes of energy and total fat. RESULTS: Over an average follow-up of 10.5 y, 1206 and 2122 pancreatic cancer cases were identified in the subcohort who completed the second questionnaire (n = 273,975) and the baseline cohort (n = 501,698), respectively. Compared with normal weight, overweight or obesity at ages 18, 35, 50, or >50 y (baseline BMI) was significantly associated with pancreatic cancer, with HRs ranging from 1.15 to 1.53. A longer duration of BMI (in kg/m(2)) >25.0 was significantly associated with pancreatic cancer (overall HR per 10-y increment of duration: 1.06; 95% CI: 1.02, 1.09), with individuals who reported diabetes having the greatest risk (HR per 10-y increment of duration: 1.18; 95% CI: 1.05, 1.32; P-interaction = 0.01) and rates. A substantial gain in adiposity (>10 kg/m(2)) after age 50 y was significantly associated with increased pancreatic cancer risk. The etiologic fraction of pancreatic cancer explained by adiposity at any age was 14% overall and 21% in never smokers. CONCLUSION: Overweight and obesity at any age are associated with increased pancreatic cancer.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'New molecular targets and intervention strategies for breaking the obesity-pancreatic cancer link are urgently needed. Using relevant spontaneous and orthotopically transplanted murine models of pancreatic cancer, we tested the hypothesis that dietary energy balance modulation impacts pancreatic cancer development and progression through an insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I-dependent mechanism. In LSL-Kras(G12D)/Pdx-1-Cre/Ink4a/Arf(lox/+) mice, calorie restriction versus overweight- or obesity-inducing diet regimens decreased serum IGF-I, tumoral Akt/mTOR signaling, pancreatic desmoplasia, and progression to pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), and increased pancreatic tumor-free survival. Serum IGF-I, Akt/mTOR signaling, and orthotopically transplanted PDAC growth were decreased in liver-specific IGF-I-deficient mice (vs. wild-type mice), and rescued with IGF-I infusion. Thus, dietary energy balance modulation impacts spontaneous pancreatic tumorigenesis induced by mutant Kras and Ink4a deficiency, the most common genetic alterations in human pancreatic cancer. Furthermore, IGF-I and components of its downstream signaling pathway are promising mechanistic targets for breaking the obesity-pancreatic cancer link.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Previous work has shown that vitamin E delta-tocotrienol (VEDT) prolongs survival and delays progression of pancreatic cancer in the LSL-Kras(G12D)(/+);Pdx-1-Cre mouse model of pancreatic cancer. However, the effect of VEDT alone or in combination with gemcitabine in the more aggressive LSL-Kras(G12D)(/+);LSL-Trp53(R172H)(/+);Pdx-1-Cre (KPC) mouse model is unknown. Here, we studied the effects of VEDT and the combination of VEDT and gemcitabine in the KPC mice. KPC mice were randomized into four groups: (i) vehicle [olive oil, 1.0 mL/kg per os twice a day and PBS 1.0 mL/kg intrapertoneally (i.p.) twice a week], (ii) gemcitabine (100 mg/kg i.p. twice a week), (iii) VEDT (200 mg/kg per os twice a day), and (iv) gemcitabine + VEDT. Mice received treatment until they displayed symptoms of impending death from pancreatic cancer, at which point animals were euthanized. At 16 weeks, survival was 10% in the vehicle group, 30% in the gemcitabine group, 70% in the VEDT group (P < 0.01), and 90% in the VEDT combined with gemcitabine group (P < 0.05). VEDT alone and combined with gemcitabine resulted in reversal of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in tumors. Biomarkers of apoptosis (plasma CK18), PARP1 cleavage, and Bax expression were more greatly induced in tumors subjected to combined treatment versus individual treatment. Combined treatment induced cell-cycle inhibitors (p27(Kip1) and p21(Cip1)) and inhibited VEGF, vascularity (CD31), and oncogenic signaling (pAKT, pMEK, and pERK) greater than individual drugs. No significant differences in body weight gain between drug treatment and control mice were observed. These results strongly support further investigation of VEDT alone and in combination with gemcitabine for pancreatic cancer prevention and treatment.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Dietary pattern analyses characterizing combinations of food intakes offer conceptual and statistical advantages over food- and nutrient-based analyses of disease risk. However, few studies have examined dietary patterns and pancreatic cancer risk and none focused on the 2005 Dietary Guidelines for Americans. We used the Healthy Eating Index 2005 (HEI-2005) to estimate the association between meeting those dietary guidelines and pancreatic cancer risk. METHODS: We calculated the HEI-2005 score for 537 218 men and women in the National Institutes of Health-American Association of Retired Persons Diet and Health Study using responses to food frequency questionnaires returned in 1995 and 1996. We used Cox proportional hazards regression to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for risk of pancreatic cancer according to HEI-2005 quintiles and explored effect modification by known risk factors. P interaction values were calculated using the Wald test. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: We identified 2383 incident, exocrine pancreatic cancer cases (median = 10.5 years follow-up). Comparing participants who met the most dietary guidelines (Q5) with those who met the fewest guidelines (Q1), we observed a reduced risk of pancreatic cancer (HR = 0.85, 95% CI = 0.74 to 0.97). Among men there was an interaction by body mass index (P interaction = .03), with a hazard ratio of 0.72 (95% CI = 0.59 to 0.88) comparing Q5 vs Q1 in overweight/obese men (body mass index >/= 25 kg/m(2)) but no association among normal weight men. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the hypothesis that consuming a high-quality diet, as scored by the HEI-2005, may reduce the risk of pancreatic cancer.',\n",

       "  'AB': \"BACKGROUND: The unfavourable side-effects of late-stage pancreatic cancer treatments call for non-toxic and effective therapeutic approaches. We compared the overall survival (OS) of patients receiving an extract of Viscum album [L.] (VaL) or no antineoplastic therapy. METHODS: This is a prospective, parallel, open label, monocentre, group-sequential, randomised phase III study. Patients with locally advanced or metastatic cancer of the pancreas were stratified according to a binary prognosis index, composed of tumour stage, age and performance status; and were evenly randomised to subcutaneous injections of VaL extracts or no antineoplastic therapy (control). VaL was applied in a dose-escalating manner from 0.01 mg up to 10mg three times per week. Patients in both groups received best supportive care. The primary end-point was 12-month OS, assessed in a group-sequential analysis. FINDINGS: We present the first interim analysis, including data from 220 patients. Baseline characteristics were well balanced between the study arms. Median OS was 4.8 for VaL and 2.7 months for control patients (prognosis-adjusted hazard ratio, HR=0.49; p<0.0001). Within the 'good' prognosis subgroup, median OS was 6.6 versus 3.2 months (HR=0.43; p<0.0001), within the 'poor' prognosis subgroup, it was 3.4 versus 2.0 months respectively (HR=0.55; p=0.0031). No VaL-related adverse events were observed. CONCLUSION: VaL therapy showed a significant and clinically relevant prolongation of OS. The study findings suggest VaL to be a non-toxic and effective second-line therapy that offers a prolongation of OS as well as less disease-related symptoms for patients with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer.\",\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: In 1994, acrylamide (AA) was classified as a probable human carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. In 2002, AA was discovered at relatively high concentrations in some starchy, plant-based foods cooked at high temperatures. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective analysis was conducted to evaluate the association between the dietary intake of AA and ductal adenocarcinoma of the exocrine pancreatic cancer (PC) risk in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) cohort using Cox regression modeling. EPIC includes >500,000 men and women aged 35-75 at enrollment from 10 European countries. AA intake was estimated for each participant by combining questionnaire-based food consumption data with a harmonized AA database derived from the EU monitoring database of AA levels in foods, and evaluated in quintiles and continuously. RESULTS: After a mean follow-up of 11 years, 865 first incident adenocarcinomas of the exocrine pancreas were observed and included in the present analysis. At baseline, the mean dietary AA intake in EPIC was 26.22 microg/day. No overall association was found between continuous or quintiles of dietary AA intake and PC risk in EPIC (HR:0.95, 95%CI:0.89-1.01 per 10 microg/day). There was no effect measure modification by smoking status, sex, diabetes, alcohol intake or geographic region. However, there was an inverse association (HR: 0.73, 95% CI: 0.61-0.88 per 10 microg/day) between AA intake and PC risk in obese persons as defined using the body mass index (BMI, >/= 30 kg/m(2)), but not when body fatness was defined using waist and hip circumference or their ratio. CONCLUSIONS: Dietary intake of AA was not associated with an increased risk of PC in the EPIC cohort.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: It is clear that genetic variations in the fat mass and obesity-associated (FTO) gene affect body mass index and the risk of obesity. Given the mounting evidence showing a positive association between obesity and pancreatic cancer, this study aimed to investigate the relation between variants in the FTO gene, obesity and pancreatic cancer risk. METHODS: We conducted a hospital-based case-control study in Japan to investigate whether genetic variations in the FTO gene were associated with pancreatic cancer risk. We genotyped rs9939609 in the FTO gene of 360 cases and 400 control subjects. An unconditional logistic model was used to estimate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for the association between rs9939609 and pancreatic cancer risk. RESULTS: The minor allele frequency of rs9939609 was 0.18 among control subjects. BMI was not associated with pancreatic cancer risk. Compared with individuals with the common homozygous TT genotype, those with the heterozygous TA genotype and the minor homozygous AA genotype had a 48% (OR=1.48; 95%CI: 1.07-2.04), and 66% increased risk (OR=1.66; 95%CI: 0.70-3.90), respectively, of pancreatic cancer after adjustment for sex, age, body mass index, cigarette smoking and history of diabetes. The per-allele OR was 1.41 (95%CI: 1.07-1.85). There were no significant interactions between TA/AA genotypes and body mass index. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that rs9939609 in the FTO gene is associated with pancreatic cancer risk in Japanese subjects, possibly through a mechanism that is independent of obesity. Further investigation and replication of our results is required in other independent samples.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Since pancreatic cancer is a lethal disease, developing prevention strategies is an important goal. We determined whether calorie restriction would prevent the development and delay progression of pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasms to pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) in LSL-KrasG12D/+; Pdx-1/Cre mice that develop all the precursor lesions that progress to PDA. Eight-week-old LSL-KrasG12D; Pdx-1/Cre mice were assigned to three groups: (1) ad libitum (AL) fed the AIN93M diet or (2) intermittently calorie restricted (ICR) a modified AIN93M at 50% of AL intake followed by one week intervals at 100% of AL intake, or (3) chronically calorie restricted (CCR) an AIN93M diet at 75% of AL intake. AL fed mice had a greater percentage of pancreatic ducts with PanIN-2 (13.6%) than did the ICR (1.0%) and CCR groups (1.6%), P < 0.0001. Calorie restriction (ICR [0%] and CCR [0.7%]) reduced the percentage of ducts with PanIN-3 lesions compared to the AL group (7.0%), P < 0.0001. The incidence of PanIN-2 or more lesions was significantly reduced in both ICR (27%; n = 16) and CCR (40%) mice (n = 15; P < 0.001) compared to AL (70%) fed mice (n = 11). The delayed progression of lesions in ICR and CCR mice was associated with reduced proliferation measured by proliferating cell nuclear antigen staining, reduced protein expression of Glut1, increased protein expression of Sirt1, increased serum adiponectin, and decreased serum leptin. CCR resulted in decreased phosphorylated mammalian target of rapamycin and decreased serum insulin-like growth factor-1. In summary, this is the first study to show in LSL-KrasG12D; Pdx-1/Cre mice that ICR and CCR delay the progression of lesions to PDA.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Signaling from other angiokinases may underlie resistance to VEGF-directed therapy. We evaluated the antitumor and biologic effects of BIBF 1120 (nintedanib), a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets VEGF receptor, platelet-derived growth factor receptor, and fibroblast growth factor receptor in preclinical models of lung and pancreatic cancer, including models resistant to VEGF-targeted treatments. In vitro, BIBF 1120 did not show antiproliferative effects, nor did it sensitize tumor cells to chemotherapy. However, in vivo BIBF 1120 inhibited primary tumor growth in all models as a single agent and in combination with standard chemotherapy. Analysis of tumor tissue posttreatment revealed that BIBF 1120 reduced proliferation (phospho-histone 3) and elevated apoptosis (cleaved caspase-3) to a greater extent than chemotherapy alone. Furthermore, BIBF 1120 showed potent antiangiogenic effects, including decreases in microvessel density (CD31), pericyte coverage (NG2), vessel permeability, and perfusion, while increasing hypoxia. Despite the induction of hypoxia, markers of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) were not elevated in BIBF 1120-treated tumors. In summary, BIBF 1120 showed potent antitumor and antiangiogenic activity in preclinical models of lung and pancreatic cancer where it induced hypoxia but not EMT. The absence of EMT induction, which has been implicated in resistance to antiangiogenic therapies, is noteworthy. Together, these results warrant further clinical studies of BIBF 1120.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Pancreatic cancer cells exist in a hypoxic microenvironment containing numerous factors that impact tumor survival, proliferation, and metastasis. MicroRNAs (miRs) are differentially expressed in cancer but also altered by hypoxia. We hypothesized that hypoxia could induce expression of miR-21, an oncomir in pancreatic cancer cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We examined how hypoxia regulates miR-21 expression in pancreatic cancer cell lines (BxPC-3, AsPC-1) by stem-loop RT-PCR. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were used to study how hypoxia alters hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha binding to the hypoxia response element of miR-21. BxPC-3 and AsPC-1 cells were transfected with a constitutively stable HIF-1alpha subunit or vector control (pcDNA3.1) to determine the influence of miR-21 in normoxia. The effect of mature miR-21 sense and antisense oligonucleotides on proliferation and apoptosis in hypoxic and normoxic conditions was assessed via WST-1 assay and flow cytometry. RESULTS: MiR-21 levels increased in all cell lines grown in hypoxic conditions versus normoxia, whereas siRNA targeting HIF-1alpha reduced miR-21 expression. Hypoxic conditions resulted in direct binding of HIF-1alpha to the predicted binding site in miR-21. Transfection with a constitutively stable HIF-1alpha expression plasmid in normoxia resulted in upregulated miR-21, similar to that seen in hypoxia. Cells transfected with antisense constructs targeting miR-21 had reduced proliferation and increased apoptosis in normoxia, whereas miR-21 overexpression abrogated hypoxia-associated reductions in proliferation. CONCLUSIONS: MiR-21 is induced by hypoxia in pancreatic cancer cells via HIF-1alpha upregulation. MiR-21 overexpression allows cells to avoid apoptosis in a hypoxic microenvironment. Inhibition of miR-21 expression may increase cellular susceptibility to hypoxia in pancreatic cancer.',\n",

When these processes are deregulated (deficient or overactivated) they produce pathologic effects, such as oxidative stress, metabolic impairments, and cell death. Unresolved inflammation and disrupted regulation of autophagy are common features of pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer. Furthermore, obesity, a risk factor for pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer, promotes inflammation and inhibits or deregulates autophagy, creating an environment that facilitates the induction and progression of pancreatic diseases. However, little is known about how inflammation, autophagy, and obesity interact to promote exocrine pancreatic disorders. We review the roles of inflammation and autophagy, and their deregulation by obesity, in pancreatic diseases.

       "  'AB': \"BACKGROUND: Pancreatic cancer remains one of the deadliest cancers due to lack of early detection and absence of effective treatments. Gemcitabine, the current standard-of-care chemotherapy for pancreatic cancer, has limited clinical benefit. Treatment of pancreatic cancer cells with gemcitabine has been shown to induce the activity of the transcription factor nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) which regulates the expression of genes involved in the inflammatory response and tumorigenesis. It has therefore been proposed that gemcitabine-induced NF-kappaB activation may result in chemoresistance. We hypothesize that NF-kappaB suppression by the novel inhibitor dimethylaminoparthenolide (DMAPT) may enhance the effect of gemcitabine in pancreatic cancer. METHODS: The efficacy of DMAPT and gemcitabine was evaluated in a chemoprevention trial using the mutant Kras and p53-expressing LSL-KrasG12D/+; LSL-Trp53R172H; Pdx-1-Cre mouse model of pancreatic cancer. Mice were randomized to treatment groups (placebo, DMAPT [40 mg/kg/day], gemcitabine [50 mg/kg twice weekly], and the combination DMAPT/gemcitabine). Treatment was continued until mice showed signs of ill health at which time they were sacrificed. Plasma cytokine levels were determined using a Bio-Plex immunoassay. Statistical tests used included log-rank test, ANOVA with Dunnett's post-test, Student's t-test, and Fisher exact test. RESULTS: Gemcitabine or the combination DMAPT/gemcitabine significantly increased median survival and decreased the incidence and multiplicity of pancreatic adenocarcinomas. The DMAPT/gemcitabine combination also significantly decreased tumor size and the incidence of metastasis to the liver. No significant differences in the percentages of normal pancreatic ducts or premalignant pancreatic lesions were observed between the treatment groups. Pancreata in which no tumors formed were analyzed to determine the extent of pre-neoplasia; mostly normal ducts or low grade pancreatic lesions were observed, suggesting prevention of higher grade lesions in these animals. While gemcitabine treatment increased the levels of the inflammatory cytokines interleukin 1alpha (IL-1alpha), IL-1beta, and IL-17 in mouse plasma, DMAPT and DMAPT/gemcitabine reduced the levels of the inflammatory cytokines IL-12p40, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), macrophage inflammatory protein-1 beta (MIP-1beta), eotaxin, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), all of which are NF-kappaB target genes. CONCLUSION: In summary, these findings provide preclinical evidence supporting further evaluation of agents such as DMAPT and gemcitabine for the prevention and treatment of pancreatic cancer.\",\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: The aims of our study were to identify serum biomarkers that distinguish pancreatic cancer (pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, PDAC) patients from benign pancreatic disease patients and healthy subjects, and to assess the effects of jaundice on biomarker performance. METHODS: Isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification were used to compare pooled serum and pancreatic juice samples from a test set of 59 and 25 subjects, respectively. Validation was undertaken in 113 independent subjects. RESULTS: Candidate proteins Complement C5, inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain H3, alpha1-beta glycoprotein and polymeric immunoglobulin receptor were elevated in cancer, as were the reference markers CA19-9 and Reg3A. Biliary obstruction had a significant effect on the performance of the markers, in particular within the PDAC group where the presence of jaundice was associated with a significant increase in the levels of all six proteins (P<0.01). Consequently, in the absence of jaundice, proteins showed reduced sensitivity for PDAC patients over benign subjects and healthy controls (HCs). Similarly, in the presence of jaundice, markers showed reduced specificity for PDAC patients over benign subjects with jaundice. Combining markers enabled improved sensitivity for non-jaundiced PDAC patients over HCs and improved specificity for jaundiced PDAC patients over jaundiced benign disease subjects. CONCLUSIONS: The presence-absence of jaundice in the clinical scenario severely impacts the performance of biomarkers for PDAC diagnosis and has implications for their clinical translation.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Pancreatic neuritis is a histopathological hallmark of pancreatic neuropathy and correlates to abdominal neuropathic pain sensation in pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PCa) and chronic pancreatitis (CP). However, inflammatory cell subtypes that compose pancreatic neuritis and their correlation to the neuropathic pain syndrome in PCa and CP are yet unknown. METHODS: Inflammatory cells within pancreatic neuritis lesions of patients with PCa (n = 20) and CP (n = 20) were immunolabeled and colorimetrically quantified with the pan-leukocyte marker CD45, with CD68 (macrophages), CD8 (cytotoxic T-lymphocytes), CD4 (T-helper cells), CD20 (B-lymphocytes), NCL-PC (plasma cells), neutrophil elastase, PRG2 (eosinophils), anti-mast cell (MC) tryptase and correlated to pain sensation. Perineural mast cell subtypes were analyzed by double immunolabeling with MC chymase. Expression and neural immunoreactivity of protease-activated receptor type 1 (PAR-1) and type 2 (PAR-2) were analyzed in PCa and CP and correlated to pain status of the patients. RESULTS: In PCa and CP, nerves were predominantly infiltrated by cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (PCa: 35% of all perineural inflammatory cells, CP: 33%), macrophages (PCa: 39%, CP: 33%) and MC (PCa: 21%, CP: 27%). In both entities, neuropathic pain sensation was associated with a specific increase of perineural MC (PCa without pain: 14% vs. PCa with pain: 31%; CP without pain: 19% vs. CP with pain: 34%), not affecting the frequency of other inflammatory cell subtypes. The vast majority of these MC contained MC chymase. PAR-1 and PAR-2 expression did not correlate to the pain sensation of PCa and CP patients. CONCLUSION: Pancreatic neuritis in PC and CP is composed of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes, macrophages and MC. The specific enrichment of MC around intrapancreatic nerves in neuropathic pain due to PCa and CP suggests the presence of MC-induced visceral hypersensitivity in the pancreas. Therefore, pancreatic and enteric neuropathies seem to share a similar type of neuro-immune interaction in the generation of visceral pain.',\n",

       "  'AB': \"BACKGROUND: Endoscopic ultrasound-guided celiac plexus neurolysis (EUS-CPN) represents an alternative approach to pain palliation in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. AIM: to evaluate the safety and initial efficacy of EUS-CPN in patients with painful unresectable pancreatic cancer. METHODS: Patients with inoperable body-tail pancreatic adenocarcinoma without prior chemotherapy and pain requiring opioid analgesia were included prospectively in this cohort study in a tertiary medical center. Central EUS-CPN was performed and the brief pain inventory and the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy measurement were applied before and 2 weeks after the procedure. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients underwent the procedure in one session without complications. Follow-up revealed overall pain relief in 24 patients (75%) and significant improvement in pain scores. Ratings of pain interfering with general activity, walking, work, mood, enjoyment of life, relations with others, and sleep improved significantly. Physical, functional, and emotional well-being improved significantly, except for acceptance of illness and enjoyment of life. CONCLUSION: Central EUS-CPN was an efficient and safe method for palliative pain management in our patients with inoperable pancreatic body-tail adenocarcinoma. The pain alleviation improved the patients' functional status, sleep, and quality of life, although other variables could also be involved, but acceptance of the illness and enjoyment of life did not change after treatment.\",\n",

       "  'AB': 'Up to 85% of patients with pancreatic cancer have diabetes or hyperglycaemia, which frequently manifests as early as 2-3 years before a diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. Conversely, patients with new-onset diabetes have a 5-8-fold increased risk of being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer within 1-3 years of developing diabetes. Emerging evidence now indicates that pancreatic cancer causes diabetes. As in type 2 diabetes, beta-cell dysfunction and peripheral insulin resistance are seen in pancreatic cancer-induced diabetes. However, unlike in patients with type 2 diabetes, glucose control worsens in patients with pancreatic cancer in the face of ongoing, often profound, weight loss. Diabetes and weight loss, which precede cachexia onset by several months, are paraneoplastic phenomena induced by pancreatic cancer. Although the pathogenesis of these pancreatic cancer-induced metabolic alterations is only beginning to be understood, these are likely mechanisms to promote the survival and growth of pancreatic cancer in a hostile and highly desmoplastic microenvironment. Interestingly, these metabolic changes could enable early diagnosis of pancreatic cancer, if they can be distinguished from the ones that occur in patients with type 2 diabetes. One such possible biomarker is adrenomedullin, which is a potential mediator of beta-cell dysfunction in pancreatic cancer-induced diabetes.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'INTRODUCTION: Few tools predict survival from pancreatic cancer (PAC). The McGill Brisbane Symptom Score (MBSS) based on symptoms at presentation (weight loss, pain, jaundice and smoking) was recently validated. The present study compares the ability of four strategies to predict 9-month survival: MBSS, carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9) alone, CA19-9-to-bilirubin ratio and a combination of MBSS and the CA19-9-to-bilirubin ratio. METHODOLOGY: A retrospective review of 133 patients diagnosed with PAC between 2005 and 2011 was performed. Survival was determined from the Quebec civil registry. Blood CA 19-9 and bilirubin values were collected (n = 52) at the time of diagnosis. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to determine a cutoff for optimal test characteristics of CA 19-9 and CA19-9-to-total bilirubin ratio in predicting survival at 9 months. Predictive characteristics were then calculated for the four strategies. RESULTS: Of the four strategies, the one with the greatest negative predictive value was the MBSS: negative predictive value (NPV) was 90.2% (76.9-97.3%) and the positive likelihood ratio (LR) was the greatest. The ability of CA 19-9 levels alone, at baseline, to predict survival was low. For the CA19-9-to-bilirubin ratio, the test characteristics improved but remained non-significant. The best performing strategy according to likelihood ratios was the combined MBSS and CA19-9 to the bilirubin ratio. CONCLUSION: CA19-9 levels and the CA19-9-to-bilirubin ratio are poor predictors of survival for PAC, whereas the MBSS is a far better predictor, confirming its clinical value. By adding the CA19-9-to-bilirubin ratio to the MBSS the predictive characteristics improved.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'OBJECTIVE: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is a devastating disease, with an overall 5-year survival rate of only 3% to 5%. As the current therapies offer very limited survival benefits, novel therapeutic strategies are urgently required to treat this disease. Here, we determined whether metformin administration inhibits the growth of PANC-1 and MiaPaCa-2 tumor xenografts in vivo. METHODS: Different xenograft models, including orthotopic implantation, were used to determine whether intraperitoneal or oral administration of metformin inhibits the growth of pancreatic cancer in vivo. RESULTS: We demonstrate that metformin given once daily intraperitoneally at various doses (50-250 mg/kg) to nude mice inhibited the growth of PANC-1 xenografts in a dose-dependent manner. A significant effect of metformin was obtained at 50 mg/kg and maximal effect at 200 mg/kg. Metformin administration also caused a significant reduction in the phosphorylation of ribosomal S6 protein and ERK in these xenografts. Metformin also inhibited the growth of pancreatic cancer xenografts when administered orally (2.5 mg/mL) either before or after tumor implantation. Importantly, oral administration of metformin also inhibited the growth of MiaPaCa-2 tumors xenografted orthotopically. CONCLUSIONS: The studies presented here provide further evidence indicating that metformin offers a potential novel approach for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma prevention and therapy.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'OBJECTIVES: Etanercept blocks tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), a proinflammatory cytokine that plays a role in cancer-related cachexia and tumor growth. A phase I/II study was conducted to assess the tolerability and efficacy of gemcitabine and etanercept in advanced pancreatic cancer. METHODS: Twenty-five patients received etanercept 25 mg subcutaneously twice weekly with gemcitabine. A control cohort of 8 patients received gemcitabine alone. The primary end point was progression-free survival at 6 months. Blood specimens were analyzed for TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, interferon-gamma, IL-10, and NF-kappabeta activation. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00201838. RESULTS: Thirty-eight patients participated in this study. In the gemcitabine-etanercept cohort, grade 3/4 drug-related toxicities included leucopenia (3) and neutropenia (6). There were 3 (12%) patients with partial response and 8 (32%) patients with stable disease. The rate of progression-free survival at 6 months was 28% [n = 7; 95% confidence interval (CI), 20%-36%]. Median time to progression was 2.23 months (95% CI, 1.86-4.36 months) and median overall survival was 5.43 months (95% CI, 3.30-10.23 months). Clinical benefit rate was 33% of the evaluable patients. A correlation was seen between IL-10 levels and clinical benefit. CONCLUSIONS: Etanercept added to gemcitabine is safe but did not show significant enhancement of gemcitabine in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'OBJECTIVE: Patient-reported outcomes are important for clinical practice and research, and should reflect what patients perceive as important. The objective of this study was to develop and preliminarily validate a brief, patient-derived, disease-specific tool, the pancreatic cancer disease impact (PACADI) score. METHODS: The development was performed in two phases. Forty-one patients with confirmed pancreatic cancer (PC) selected dimensions of health related to the impact of the disease. A weighting of the eight most frequently reported dimensions was performed in a second sample of 80 PC patients who also rated the impact on eight numeric rating scales (NRS, range 0 to 10). The relative weights and the scores from the NRS were used to compute the PACADI score (range 0 to 10). The patients also completed Edmonton Symptom Assessment System (ESAS) and EQ-5D. RESULTS: Dimensions reported by more than 20% of the patients were included in the PACADI score (relative weights in parenthesis): pain/discomfort (0.16), fatigue (0.16), anxiety (0.15), bowel/digestive problems (0.14), loss of appetite (0.13), dry mouth (0.11), itchiness (0.08), and nausea (0.07). The PACADI score in the 80 PC patients had a mean (SD) value of 3.26 (2.06) (95% CI 2.80, 3.71), was moderately to strongly correlated to ESAS sense of well-being (r = 0.69) and EQ-5D (r = -0.52), and discriminated significantly between patients with and without PC. CONCLUSION: The PACADI score is a new eight-item, patient-derived, disease-specific measure. Preliminary validation regarding construct validity and discrimination encourages further validation in independent patient samples.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Hypoxia is known to play critical roles in cell survival, angiogenesis, tumor invasion, and metastasis. Hypoxia mediated over-expression of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) has been shown to be associated with therapeutic resistance, and contributes to poor prognosis of cancer patients. Emerging evidence suggest that hypoxia and HIF pathways contributes to the acquisition of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), maintenance of cancer stem cell (CSC) functions, and also maintains the vicious cycle of inflammation-all which lead to therapeutic resistance. However, the precise molecular mechanism(s) by which hypoxia/HIF drives these events are not fully understood. Here, we show, for the first time, that hypoxia leads to increased expression of VEGF, IL-6, and CSC signature genes Nanog, Oct4 and EZH2 consistent with increased cell migration/invasion and angiogenesis, and the formation of pancreatospheres, concomitant with increased expression of miR-21 and miR-210 in human pancreatic cancer (PC) cells. The treatment of PC cells with CDF, a novel synthetic compound inhibited the production of VEGF and IL-6, and down-regulated the expression of Nanog, Oct4, EZH2 mRNAs, as well as miR-21 and miR-210 under hypoxia. CDF also led to decreased cell migration/invasion, angiogenesis, and formation of pancreatospheres under hypoxia. Moreover, CDF decreased gene expression of miR-21, miR-210, IL-6, HIF-1alpha, VEGF, and CSC signatures in vivo in a mouse orthotopic model of human PC. Collectively, these results suggest that the anti-tumor activity of CDF is in part mediated through deregulation of tumor hypoxic pathways, and thus CDF could become a novel, and effective anti-tumor agent for PC therapy.',\n",

       "  'AB': \"BACKGROUND: There is no consensus on the indication for salvage chemoradiotherapy (CRT) after failure of primary chemotherapy for locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC). Here we report on the retrospective analysis of patients who received salvage CRT after primary chemotherapy for LAPC. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of salvage CRT after primary chemotherapy for LAPC. METHODS: Thirty patients who underwent salvage CRT, after the failure of primary chemotherapy for LAPC, were retrospectively enrolled from 2004 to 2011 at the authors' institution. All the patients had histologically confirmed pancreatic adenocarcinoma. RESULTS: Primary chemotherapy was continued until progression or emergence of unacceptable toxicity. Eventually, 26 patients (87%) discontinued primary chemotherapy because of local tumor progression, whereas four patients (13%) discontinued chemotherapy because of interstitial pneumonitis caused by gemcitabine. After a median period of 7.9 months from starting chemotherapy, 30 patients underwent salvage CRT combined with either S-1 or 5-FU. Toxicities were generally mild and self-limiting. Median survival time (MST) from the start of salvage CRT was 8.8 months. The 6 month, 1-year and 2-year survival rates from the start of CRT were 77%, 33% and 26%, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that a lower pre-CRT serum CA 19-9 level (</= 1000 U/ml; p = 0.009) and a single regimen of primary chemotherapy (p = 0.004) were independent prognostic factors for survival after salvage CRT. The MST for the entire patient population from the start of primary chemotherapy was 17.8 months, with 2- and 3-year overall survival rates of 39% and 22%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: CRT had moderate anti-tumor activity and an acceptable toxicity profile in patients with LAPC, even after failure of gemcitabine-based primary chemotherapy. If there are any signs of failure of primary chemotherapy without distant metastasis, salvage CRT could be a treatment of choice as a second-line therapy. Patients with relatively low serum CA19-9 levels after primary chemotherapy may achieve higher survival rates after salvage CRT. The strategy of using chemotherapy alone as a primary treatment for LAPC, followed-by CRT with salvage intent should be further investigated in prospective clinical trials.

       "  'AB': 'Pancreatic cancer (PC) remains a complex malignancy with the worst prognosis, lack of early diagnostic symptoms and resistance to conventional chemo- and radiotherapies. A better understanding of the etiology and early developmental events of PC requires profound attention. The evolution of fully blown PC from initial pancreatic injury is a multi-factorial phenomenon with a series of sequential events. The initial acute infection or tissue damage triggers inflammation that, in conjunction with innate immunity, establishes a state of homeostasis to limit harm to the body. Recurrent pancreatic injuries due to genetic susceptibility, smoking, unhealthy diet, and alcohol abuse induces a pro-inflammatory milieu, consisting of various types of immune cells, cytokines, chemokines, growth factors and restructured extracellular matrix, leading to prolonged inflammatory/chronic conditions. Cells having sustained DNA damage and/or mutagenic assault take advantage of this prolonged inflammatory response and aid in the initiation and development of neoplastic/fibrotic events. Eventually, many tumor-stromal interactions result in a chaotic environment accompanied by a loss of immune surveillance and repair response, thereby leading to PC. A better understanding of the inflammatory markers defining this \"injury-inflammation-cancer\" pathway would help to identify novel molecular targets for early screening and therapeutic intervention for this lethal malignancy.',\n",

Endoscopic biliary drainage is still requested in the majority of patients who present with obstructive jaundice, and the increased use of self-expandable metallic stents has reduced the incidence of premature stent occlusion. First-line use of metallic stents is expected to be utilized more frequently as neoadjuvant protocols are improved. The efficacy of endoscopy for palliating gastroduodenal obstruction has advanced with the development of through-the-scope, self-expandable gastroduodenal stents. There have been advances in pain management, with endoscopic ultrasound-guided celiac plexus neurolysis reducing opiate requirements and pain for patients with unresectable malignancy. Future applications of endoscopy in pancreatic cancer may include fine-needle injection of chemotherapeutic and other agents into the lesion itself.

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Obesity has been consistently associated with increased risk of pancreatic cancer incidence and mortality. However, studies of obesity and overall survival in patients with pancreatic cancer are notably lacking, especially in population-based studies. METHODS: Active and passive follow-up were used to determine vital status and survival for 510 pancreatic cancer patients diagnosed from 1995 to 1999 in a large population-based case-control study in the San Francisco Bay Area. Survival rates were computed using Kaplan-Meier methods. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) were estimated in multivariable Cox proportional hazards models as measures of the association between pre-diagnostic obesity and pancreatic cancer survival. RESULTS: An elevated hazard ratio of 1.3 (95 % CI, 0.91-1.81) was observed for obese [body mass index (BMI) >/= 30] compared with normal range BMI (<25) patients. Associations between BMI and overall survival did not statistically significantly vary by known prognostic and risk factors (all p-interaction >/=0.18), yet elevated HRs consistently were observed for obese compared with normal BMI patients [localized disease at diagnosis (HR, 3.1), surgical resection (HR, 1.6), ever smokers (HR, 1.6), diabetics (HR, 3.3)]. Poor survival was observed among men, older patients, more recent and current smokers, whereas improved survival was observed for Asian/Pacific Islanders. CONCLUSIONS: Our results in general provide limited support for an association between pre-diagnostic obesity and decreased survival in patients with pancreatic cancer. Patterns of reduced survival associated with obesity in some patient subgroups could be due to chance and require assessment in larger pooled studies.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Cachexia, a >10% loss of body-weight, is one factor determining the poor prognosis of pancreatic cancer. Deficiency of L-Carnitine has been proposed to cause cancer cachexia. FINDINGS: We screened 152 and enrolled 72 patients suffering from advanced pancreatic cancer in a prospective, multi-centre, placebo-controlled, randomized and double-blinded trial to receive oral L-Carnitine (4 g) or placebo for 12 weeks. At entry patients reported a mean weight loss of 12 +/- 2.5 (SEM) kg. During treatment body-mass-index increased by 3.4 +/- 1.4% under L-Carnitine and decreased (-1.5 +/- 1.4%) in controls (p < 0.05). Moreover, nutritional status (body cell mass, body fat) and quality-of-life parameters improved under L-Carnitine. There was a trend towards an increased overall survival in the L-Carnitine group (median 519 +/- 50 d versus 399 +/- 43 d, not significant) and towards a reduced hospital-stay (36 +/- 4d versus 41 +/- 9d,n.s.). CONCLUSION: While these data are preliminary and need confirmation they indicate that patients with pancreatic cancer may have a clinically relevant benefit from the inexpensive and well tolerated oral supplementation of L-Carnitine.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Cancer cachexia is a progressive wasting syndrome and the most prevalent characteristic of cancer in patients with advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma. We hypothesize that genes expressed in wasted skeletal muscle of pancreatic cancer patients may determine the initiation and severity of cachexia syndrome. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We studied gene expression in skeletal muscle biopsies from pancreatic cancer patients with and without cachexia utilizing Real-Imaging cDNA-AFLP-based transcript profiling for genome-wide expression analysis. RESULTS: Our approach yielded 183 cachexia-associated genes. Ontology analysis revealed characteristic changes for a number of genes involved in muscle contraction, actin cytoskeleton rearrangement, protein degradation, tissue hypoxia, immediate early response and acute-phase response. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that Real-Imaging cDNA-AFLP analysis is a robust method for high-throughput gene expression studies of cancer cachexia syndrome in patients with pancreatic cancer. According to quantitative RT-PCR validation, the expression levels of genes encoding the acute-phase proteins alpha-antitrypsin and fibrinogen alpha and the immediate early response genes Egr-1 and IER-5 were significantly elevated in the skeletal muscle of wasted patients. By immunohistochemical and Western immunoblotting analysis it was shown, that Egr-1 expression is significantly increased in patients with cachexia and cancer. This provides new evidence that chronic activation of systemic inflammatory response might be a common and unifying factor of muscle cachexia.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'CONTEXT: In pancreatic cancer, the presence of obesity or weight loss is associated with higher mortality. OBJECTIVES: To explore the relationships among body mass index, longitudinal body composition alterations, and clinical outcomes in pancreatic cancer patients. METHODS: Records of 41 patients with inoperable locally advanced pancreatic cancer who participated in a prospective chemoradiation study were reviewed. Body composition was analyzed from two sets of computed tomography images obtained before and after radiation treatment (median interval 104 days). RESULTS: Median age was 59 years and 56% of patients were female. Twenty-four (59%) patients were either overweight (22%) or obese (37%). Sarcopenia was present in 26 (63%) patients. At follow-up, weight loss was experienced by 33 (81%) patients. The median losses (%) before and after treatment were weight 5% (P<0.001), skeletal muscle (SKM) 4% (P=0.003), visceral adipose tissue (VAT) 13% (P<0.001), and subcutaneous adipose tissue 11% (P=0.002). SKM loss positively correlated with age (P=0.03), baseline body mass index (P<0.001), and VAT (P=0.04) index. Obese patients experienced higher losses in weight (P=0.009), SKM (P=0.02), and VAT (P=0.02). Median survival was 12 months. In univariate analysis, age, baseline obesity, sarcopenic obesity, and losses (%) in weight, SKM, and VAT were associated with worse survival. In multivariate analysis, only age (hazard ratio=1.033, P=0.04) and higher VAT loss (hazard ratio=2.6 and P=0.03) remained significant. CONCLUSION: Our preliminary findings suggest that obese patients experience higher losses in weight, SKM, and VAT, which may contribute to poorer survival in these patients.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Over 8000 new pancreatic cancers are diagnosed annually in the UK; most at an advanced stage, with only 3% 5-year survival. We aimed to identify and quantify the risk of pancreatic cancer for features in primary care. METHODS: A case-control study using electronic primary care records identified and quantified the features of pancreatic cancer. Cases, aged >/=40 in the General Practice Research Database, UK, with primary pancreatic cancer were matched with controls on age, sex and practice. Putative features of pancreatic cancer were identified in the year before diagnosis. Odds ratios (OR) were calculated for features of cancer using conditional logistic regression. Positive predictive values (PPV) were calculated for consulting patients. RESULTS: In all, 3635 cases and 16,459 controls were studied. Nine features were associated with pancreatic cancer (all P<0.001 except for back pain, P=0.004); jaundice, OR 1000 (95% confidence interval (CI) 4,302,500); abdominal pain, 5 (4.4, 5.6); nausea/vomiting, 4.5 (3.5, 5.7); back pain, 1.4 (1.1, 1.7); constipation, 2.2 (1.7, 2.8); diarrhoea, 1.9 (1.5, 2.5); weight loss, 15 (11, 22); malaise, 2.4 (1.6, 3.5); new-onset diabetes 2.1 (1.7, 2.5). Positive predictive values for patients aged >/=60 were <1%, apart from jaundice at 22% (95% CI 14, 52), though several pairs of symptoms had PPVs >1%. CONCLUSION: Most previously reported symptoms of pancreatic cancer were also relevant in primary care. Although predictive values were small - apart from jaundice - they provide a basis for selection of patients for investigation, especially with multiple symptoms.',\n",

       "  'AB': \"Computed Tomography (CT)-guided percutaneous cryoablation was performed in a 43-year-old patient with intractable epigastric abdominal pain caused by advanced adenocarcinoma of the pancreas and extensive celiac trunk involvement. Initial treatment with celiac plexus nerve neurolysis using local ethanol injection was unsuccessful. A 17-gauge 17-cm cryoablation probe (Galil Medical Inc. Plymouth Meeting, PA) was placed into the expected location of the celiac plexus through a left paraspinal approach under CT guidance and two cycles of freeze-thaw were performed. Patient's pain decreased from 10 of 10 (subjective pain scoring using a visual analog scale; VAS; 0-10) to 3. No post-procedure complication was observed. His pain has remained stable after 6 months of follow up. Percutaneous cryoablation appears to be an effective alternative to neurolytic celiac plexus block for palliative treatment of celiac plexus involvement. Further study with larger number of patients is needed to evaluate the safety and efficacy.\",\n",

Similar statistics are observed for other industrialized nations. With new evidence to suggest that pancreatic cancer develops over a number of years, markers that can better identify high risk patients and are applicable to earlier diagnosis hold promise for improving these dire statistics. Obesity is one of the few modifiable risk factors that has been associated with increased risk of pancreatic cancer and also is related to increased risk of diabetes, a condition that in turn has been associated with pancreatic cancer development. Given recent data that nearly 70% of United States adults are overweight or obese, a clarification of the complex association between obesity and pancreatic cancer may disclose targets for prevention and intervention to decrease incidence and improve prognosis of this highly fatal disease. An overview of the current epidemiology and hypothesized biological mechanisms involved in the obesity-pancreatic cancer association are presented.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'CONTEXT: Gemcitabine for advanced pancreatic cancer (APC) is palliative and the prognosis is poor, making health-related quality of life (HRQOL) particularly important. OBJECTIVES: We evaluated HRQOL with the EuroQol (EQ-5D) in patients with APC participating in Cancer and Leukemia Group B 80303, a multicenter, double-blind, randomized trial comparing overall survival (OS) between two treatment arms: gemcitabine with bevacizumab or gemcitabine with placebo. METHODS: A consecutive subsample of patients was invited to complete the EQ-5D surveys. Because neither clinical nor HRQOL outcomes differed based on the study arm, analyses were pooled. Changes in mean scores from baseline to eight weeks and the prognostic value of the EQ-5D were evaluated. RESULTS: Mean index scores remained stable (0.78 at baseline [n=267], 0.79 at eight weeks [n=186], P=0.34, Wilcoxon signed rank test), attributable to a modest deterioration of physical function domain scores coincident with small improvements in pain and anxiety/depression scores. A small decline in visual analogue scale scores was observed (70.7 vs. 68.2, P=0.026). HRQOL changes within chemotherapy response strata revealed stable index scores but a trend of worsened physical function among patients with disease progression compared with those with stable or improved disease. Visual analogue scale scores trended downward over time irrespective of chemotherapy response status, with a statistically meaningful deterioration in patients who progressed (68.9 vs. 64.4, P=0.029). Baseline scores from both EQ-5D scales were significant predictors of OS in Cox proportional hazard models. CONCLUSION: Response to gemcitabine treatment in APC is not associated with appreciable improvement of global HRQOL. Small improvements in pain and mood are observed despite progressive functional decline. Those who respond to gemcitabine may experience a slight slowing of functional deterioration.',\n",

       "  'AB': \"BACKGROUND: Questions remain about the shape of the dose-response relationship between body mass index (BMI) and pancreatic cancer risk, possible confounding by smoking, and differences by gender or geographic location. Whether abdominal obesity increases risk is unclear. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective studies of the association between BMI, abdominal fatness and pancreatic cancer risk and searched PubMed and several other databases up to January 2011. Summary relative risks (RRs) were calculated using a random-effects model. RESULTS: Twenty-three prospective studies of BMI and pancreatic cancer risk with 9504 cases were included. The summary RR for a 5-unit increment was 1.10 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.07-1.14, I(2) = 19%] and results were similar when stratified by gender and geographic location. There was evidence of a non-linear association, P(non-linearity) = 0.005; however, among nonsmokers, there was increased risk even within the 'normal' BMI range. The summary RR for a 10-cm increase in waist circumference was 1.11 (95% CI 1.05-1.18, I(2) = 0%) and for a 0.1-unit increment in waist-to-hip ratio was 1.19 (95% CI 1.09-1.31, I(2) = 11%). CONCLUSIONS: Both general and abdominal fatness increases pancreatic cancer risk. Among nonsmokers, risk increases even among persons within the normal BMI range.\",\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) induced by hypoxia is one of the critical causes of treatment failure in different types of human cancers. NF-kappaB is closely involved in the progression of EMT. Compared with HIF-1alpha, the correlation between NF-kappaB and EMT during hypoxia has been less studied, and although the phenomenon was observed in the past, the molecular mechanisms involved remained unclear. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, we report that hypoxia or overexpression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) promotes EMT in pancreatic cancer cells. On molecular or pharmacologic inhibition of NF-kappaB, hypoxic cells regained expression of E-cadherin, lost expression of N-cadherin, and attenuated their highly invasive and drug-resistant phenotype. Introducing a pcDNA3.0/HIF-1alpha into pancreatic cancer cells under normoxic conditions heightened NF-kappaB activity, phenocopying EMT effects produced by hypoxia. Conversely, inhibiting the heightened NF-kappaB activity in this setting attenuated the EMT phenotype. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These results suggest that hypoxia or overexpression of HIF-1alpha induces the EMT that is largely dependent on NF-kappaB in pancreatic cancer cells.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Diabetes, obesity, and cigarette smoke, consistent risk factors for pancreatic cancer, are sources of oxidative stress in humans that could cause mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) damage and increase mtDNA copy number. To test whether higher mtDNA copy number is associated with increased incident pancreatic cancer, we conducted a nested case-control study in the Alpha-Tocopherol Beta Carotene Cancer Prevention (ATBC) Study cohort of male smokers, aged 50 to 69 years at baseline. Between 1992 and 2004, 203 incident cases of pancreatic adenocarcinoma occurred (follow-up: 12 years) among participants, with whole blood samples used for mtDNA extraction. For these cases and 656 controls, we calculated ORs and 95% CIs using unconditional logistic regression, adjusting for age, smoking, and diabetes history. All statistical tests were two sided. Higher mtDNA copy number was significantly associated with increased pancreatic cancer risk (highest vs. lowest mtDNA copy number quintile, OR = 1.64, 95% CI = 1.01-2.67, continuous OR = 1.14, 95% CI 1.06-1.23), particularly for cases diagnosed during the first 7 years of follow-up (OR = 2.14, 95% CI = 1.16-3.96, P(trend) = 0.01, continuous OR = 1.21, 95% CI = 1.10-1.33), but not for cases occurring during follow-up of 7 years or greater (OR = 1.14, 95% CI = 0.53-2.45, continuous OR = 1.05, 95% CI = 0.93-1.18). Our results support the hypothesis that mtDNA copy number is associated with pancreatic cancer and could possibly serve as a biomarker for pancreatic cancer development.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Pancreatic cancer is 1 of the most common and poorly treated tumors. In search of new therapeutic approaches, the oxygen sensors prolyl hydroxylases (PHD) are potential targets. PHD2 is considered the key oxygen sensor-regulating hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF). Currently, there is conflicting evidence regarding the exact role of PHD2 in tumorigenesis. The objective of this study was to investigate the role of PHD2 in pancreatic cancer growth and progression. METHODS: PHD2 expression was analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis and immunohistochemistry in human tissue specimens and cell lines. Knockdown of PHD2 was done by using short-interfering RNAs (siRNAs) specific against PHD2, and PHD2 overexpression was achieved by stable combinational DNA transfection. In vivo, an orthotopic murine model was used. Angiogenic cytokines were assessed with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, and invasion was studied with Matrigel assays. RESULTS: PHD2 expression was not altered substantially in cancer tissues and their metastases. Lymph node-negative tissues had higher levels of PHD2 than lymph node-positive tissues. PHD2 was hypoxia-inducible in pancreatic cancer cell lines and regulated cell growth through cyclin D1 down-regulation samples with PHD2 suppression and through p21 up-regulation in samples with of PHD2 overexpression. In vivo, PHD2 caused tumor growth retardation and reduced tumor invasion by inhibiting angiogenesis. This observation was caused by the suppression of angiogenic cytokines and tumor invasion. CONCLUSIONS: The current results indicated that PHD2 plays an important role in pancreatic tumorigenesis. In summary, the authors concluded that PHD2 may function as a tumor suppressor gene in pancreatic cancer and, thus, may define a potential target for the treatment of pancreatic cancer.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Intratumoral hypoxia is known to lead to increased aggressiveness and distant metastasis. However, the interplay underlying these actions is still unknown. OBJECTIVE: We explored whether cancer cells might acquire a stem-like phenotype under hypoxia, consequently leading to an aggressive phenotype, including invasiveness and metastasis. METHODS: Under normoxia (20% O(2)) or hypoxia (1% O(2)), the expression of CD133 (cancer stem cell marker), CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) and hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) was examined by RT-PCR and immunostaining using human pancreatic cancer cell lines. We also examined if hypoxia facilitates the invasiveness of CD133+ cancer cells. Furthermore, we transfected dominant active HIF-1alpha (HIF-1alphaDeltaODD) by the retroviral gene transfer and examined the effects both in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS: Compared with normoxia, hypoxia elevated the expression of CD133, CXCR4 and HIF-1alpha. Moreover, hypoxia facilitated the invasiveness of CD133+ pancreatic cancer cells. The behavior of HIF-1alphaDeltaODD-transfected cells under normoxia was compatible with that of the parent cells under hypoxia. Furthermore, a xenograft model of HIF-1alphaDeltaODD cells showed aggressiveness, including metastasis and highly tumorigenic ability. CONCLUSION: Hypoxia induces tumor aggressiveness associated with the expansion of CD133+ pancreatic cancer cells in a predominantly HIF-1alpha-dependent manner.',\n",

       "  'AB': \"BACKGROUND: Although hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance have been hypothesized to be involved in pancreatic carcinogenesis, studies that have examined glycemic load or individual dietary components that influence glucose concentrations yielded inconclusive results. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to investigate whether dietary insulin load and dietary insulin index are associated with the risk of pancreatic cancer. DESIGN: We prospectively followed 86,740 women and 46,147 men who were free of cancer and diabetes at baseline in the Nurses' Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study. During </=26 y of follow-up, 691 pancreatic cancer cases were documented. Dietary insulin load was calculated as a function of the food insulin index, and the energy content of individual foods was reported on food-frequency questionnaires. The dietary insulin index was calculated by dividing the dietary insulin load by the total energy intake. RESULTS: Dietary insulin load and dietary insulin index were not associated with the overall risk of pancreatic cancer. In a comparison of the highest with the lowest quintiles, the pooled multivariate RRs of pancreatic cancer were 1.05 (95% CI: 0.82, 1.34) for dietary insulin load and 0.96 (95% CI: 0.75, 1.23) for dietary insulin index. In individuals with an elevated BMI (in kg/m(2); >/=27.5) or with low physical activity, a high insulin load was associated with small, nonsignificant increases in the risk of pancreatic cancer; in a comparison of the highest with the lowest tertile of intake, the positive association became more apparent in those who were both overweight and inactive (RR: 2.03; 95% CI: 1.05, 3.93; P-trend = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: A diet that induces an elevated postprandial insulin response does not influence the overall risk of pancreatic cancer. However, a diet with a high insulin load may increase the risk in individuals with a preexisting state of insulin resistance.\",\n",

Identifying and treating disease related symptoms are very important. As a physician taking care of these patients it is essential to know these symptoms and treatment modalities. Common problems include biliary obstruction, anticoagulation, and pain management. This review discusses the data presented at the 2011 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting symptom management and supportive care strategies including Abstracts #e14665, #e14622, and #LBA9014. Success is needed in managing these symptoms to palliate patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. It is important for oncologists to recognize the importance of supportive measures that can minimize the symptoms of advanced disease and side effects of cancer treatment.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'OBJECTIVES: New-onset diabetes mellitus (DM) may herald pancreatic cancer (PaC). We determined whether changes in body weight distinguished PaC-associated DM (PaCDM) from type 2 DM. METHODS: Among Olmsted County residents, we identified 29 PaCDM and 43 type 2 DM subjects who had serial fasting blood glucose measurements, new-onset DM, and no cancer-specific symptoms at DM onset. We compared body weight (kg) and fasting blood glucose (mg/dL) at DM onset, 1 to 2 years before and at index date in the 2 groups. RESULTS: Fasting blood glucose values were similar before and at the onset of DM. Before onset of DM, PaCDM and type 2 DM subjects had similar body weight (P = 0.80). However, at onset of DM, 59% of PaCDM subjects lost weight versus 30% of type 2 DM subjects (P = 0.02). At onset of DM, 56% of type 2 DM subjects gained weight versus 31% of PaCDM subjects (P = 0.04). By index date, PaCDM subjects lost more weight than type 2 DM subjects did (8.3 +/- 8.3 vs 0.8 +/- 4.8 kg, P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Although new-onset primary type 2 DM is typically associated with weight gain, weight loss frequently precedes onset of PaCDM. The paradoxical development of diabetes in the face of ongoing weight loss may be an important clue to understanding the pathogenesis of PaCDM.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Etiologic factors for pancreatic cancer, the 4th deadliest malignant neoplasm in the United States, include obesity and abnormal glucose metabolism. Calorie restriction (CR) and rapamycin each affect energy metabolism and cell survival pathways via inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling. By using a Panc02 murine pancreatic cancer cell transplant model in 45 male C57BL/6 mice, we tested the hypothesis that rapamycin mimics the effects of CR on pancreatic tumor growth. A chronic regimen of CR, relative to an ad libitum-fed control diet, produced global metabolic effects such as reduced body weight (20.6 +/- 1.6 g vs. 29.3 +/- 2.3 g; P < 0.0001), improved glucose responsiveness, and decreased circulating levels of insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 (126 +/- 8 ng/mL vs. 199 +/- 11 ng/mL; P = 0.0006) and leptin (1.14 +/- 0.2 ng/mL vs. 5.05 +/- 1.2 ng/mL; P = 0.01). In contrast, rapamycin treatment (2.5 mg/kg intraperitoneal every other day, initiated in mice following 20 weeks of ad libitum control diet consumption), relative to control diet, produced no significant change in body weight, IGF-1 or leptin levels, but decreased glucose responsiveness. Pancreatic tumor volume was significantly reduced in the CR group (221 +/- 107 mm(3); P < 0.001) and, to a lesser extent, the rapamycin group (374 +/- 206 mm(3); P = 0.04) relative to controls (550 +/- 147 mm(3)), and this differential inhibition correlated with expression of the proliferation marker Ki-67. Both CR and rapamycin decreased phosphorylation of mTOR, p70/S6K, and S6 ribosomal protein, but only CR decreased phosphorylation of Akt, GSK-3beta, extracellular signal regulated kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase, and STAT3(TYR705). These findings suggest that rapamycin partially mimics the anticancer effects of CR on tumor growth in a murine model of pancreatic cancer.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'The relationship between two measures of excess body weight, body mass index (BMI) and body size score, and risk of pancreatic cancer was examined among 574 pancreatic cancer cases and 596 frequency-matched controls from the Czech Republic and Slovakia enrolled between 2004 and 2009. Analyses using multivariable logistic regression showed an increased risk of pancreatic cancer associated with elevated quartiles of BMI at ages 20 [fourth quartile: odds ratio (OR) = 1.79, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.23, 2.61] and 40 (fourth quartile: OR = 1.57, 95% CI: 1.09, 2.27) compared to the lowest quartile. Consistent results were observed for body size score at ages 20 (high versus low: OR = 1.66, 95% CI: 1.08, 2.57) and 40 (medium versus low: OR = 1.36, 95% CI: 1.00, 1.86), but no association was found for BMI and body size score at 2 years before the interview. Stronger risk estimates for BMI were observed in males than females, particularly at age 20, but the analysis of body size yielded similar estimates by sex. When considering excess body weight at both ages 20 and 40 jointly, the highest risk estimates were observed among subjects with elevated levels at both time periods in the analysis of BMI (OR = 1.86, 95% CI: 1.32, 2.62) and body size (OR = 1.53, 95% CI: 1.09, 2.13). These findings, based on two different measures, provide strong support for an increased risk of pancreatic cancer associated with excess body weight, possibly strongest during early adulthood.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'AIM: To investigate predilection sites of recurrence of pancreatic cancer by computed tomography (CT) in follow-up after surgery. METHODS: Seventy seven patients with recurrence after pancreatic cancer surgery were retrospectively identified. The operative technique, R-status, T-stage and development of tumor markers were evaluated. Two radiologists analyzed CT scans with consensus readings. Location of local recurrence, lymph node recurrence and organ metastases were noted. Surgery and progression of findings on follow-up CT were considered as reference standard. RESULTS: The mean follow-up interval was 3.9 +/- 1.8 mo, with a mean relapse-free interval of 12.9 +/- 10.4 mo. The predominant site of recurrence was local (65%), followed by lymph node (17%), liver metastasis (11%) and peritoneal carcinosis (7%). Local recurrence emerged at the superior mesenteric artery (n = 28), the hepatic artery (n = 8), in an area defined by the surrounding vessels: celiac trunk, portal vein, inferior vena cava (n = 22), and in a space limited by the mesenteric artery, portal vein and inferior vena cava (n = 17). Lymph node recurrence occurred in the mesenteric root and left lateral to the aorta. Recurrence was confirmed by surgery (n = 22) and follow-up CT (n = 55). Tumor markers [carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)] increased in accordance with signs of recurrence in most cases (86% CA19-9; 79.2% CEA). CONCLUSION: Specific changes of local and lymph node recurrence can be found in the course of the cardinal peripancreatic vessels. The superior mesenteric artery is the leading structure for recurrence.',\n",

       "  'AB': \"BACKGROUND: Pancreatic cancer causes severe pain in 50 to 70% of patients and is often difficult to treat. Celiac plexus block (CPB) is thought to be a safe and effective technique for reducing the severity of pain. OBJECTIVES: To determine the efficacy and safety of celiac plexus neurolysis in reducing pancreatic cancer pain, and to identify adverse effects and differences in efficacy between the different techniques. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched Cochrane CENTRAL, MEDLINE, GATEWAY and EMBASE from 1990 to December 2010. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of CPB by the percutaneous approach or endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS)-guided neurolysis in adults with pancreatic cancer at any stage, with a minimum of four weeks follow-up. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We recorded details of study design, participants, disease, setting, outcome assessors, pain intensity (visual analogue scale (VAS)) and methods of calculation. MAIN RESULTS: The search identified 102 potentially eligible studies. Judged from the information in the title and abstract six of these concerning the percutaneous block, involving 358 participants, fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were included in the review. All were RCTs in which the participants were followed for at least four weeks. We excluded studies published only as abstracts. We identified one RCT comparing EUS-guided or computed tomography (CT) -guided CPB but its aim was to assess efficacy in controlling chronic abdominal pain associated with chronic pancreatitis rather than pancreatic cancer, so it was excluded.For pain (VAS) at four weeks the mean difference was -0.42 in favour of CPB (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.70 to - 0.13, P = 0.004, fixed-effect model). At eight weeks the mean difference was -0.44 (95% CI -0.89 to - 0.01, random-effects model). At eight weeks there was significant heterogeneity (I(2) = 89%).Opioid consumption was significantly lower in the CPB group than the control group (P < 0.00001).  AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Although statistical evidence is minimal for the superiority of pain relief over analgesic therapy, the fact that CPB causes fewer adverse effects than opioids is important for patients. Further studies and RCTs are recommended to demonstrate the potential efficacy of a less invasive technique under EUS guidance.\",\n",

       "  'AB': 'OBJECTIVE: To observe the effects of Qingyihuaji formula (QYHJ) on the progression of liver metastases from human pancreatic cancer and to detect the expression changes of some biological factors associated with angiogenesis and metastasis during the development of advanced pancreatic cancer. METHODS: Nude mice were inoculated intrasplenically with human pancreatic cancer cell line SW1990 and then randomly assigned into 4 groups: a control group and groups QYHJ-A, QYHJ-B, and QYHJ-C. Following this, the mice were treated with or without QYHJ formula for 4 weeks and were sacrificed at the end of the sixth week. The changes in body weight were observed, followed by the livers being excised and weighed. Then, both the numbers and the volume of metastatic nodules per liver were evaluated. Subsequently, the expressions of MMPs, VEGF, and Cyr61 in the tissue of liver metastases were detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, immunohistochemistry, or Western blot. Finally, the correlation was evaluated between the expressions of the factors associated with metastasis and the growth of liver metastasis. RESULTS: Liver metastases were identified in 11 of 15 mice (73%) in the control group, 9 of 15 mice (60%) in group QYHJ-A, 6 of 14 mice (43%) in group QYHJ-B, and 8 of 14 mice (57%) in group QYHJ-C both the number and the volume of metastatic nodules per liver same as the ratio of liver-body weight in QYHJ groups were significantly less than the controlled group (P < 0.05). The expressions of Cyr61, MMP-2, and VEGF at the levels of mRNA and protein were decreased in the QYHJ groups when compared with the control, as confirmed by immunohistochemistry detection (P < .05). However, no significant difference was observed in the mRNA expression of MMP-1 and MMP-9 between the QYHJ groups and the control group (P > .05). Regression analysis indicated that QYHJ possessed an evident inhibition against the progression of liver metastasis by downregulating the expression of VEGF and Cyr61 rather than MMP-2. CONCLUSIONS: The QYHJ formula exerted an inhibitory effect on the growth of liver metastasis from pancreatic cancer, perhaps by targeting VEGF and Cyr61 to some extent.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: It is unclear whether plastic or metal stents are more suitable for preoperative biliary decompression in pancreatic cancer. The objective of this study was to compare the rate of endoscopic reinterventions in patients with pancreatic cancer undergoing plastic or self-expandable metal stent (SEMS) placements for preoperative biliary decompression. METHODS: This was a retrospective study of all patients with obstructive jaundice secondary to pancreatic head cancer who underwent their index endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and all follow-up biliary stent placements at our center before undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy. Plastic or SEMS were placed at ERCP for biliary decompression. The main outcome measure was to compare the rate of endoscopic reinterventions between the plastic and SEMS cohorts. RESULTS: 29 patients who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy had preoperative biliary stent placement (18 plastic, 11 SEMS) at our center. Whereas none of the 11 patients who underwent SEMS placement had stent dysfunction, 7 of 18 (39%) patients with plastic stents required endoscopic reintervention before surgery (P=0.02). Reinterventions were due to cholangitis (n=1) or persistent elevation in serum bilirubin levels (n=6). Two patients with SEMS underwent EUS-guided fine-needle aspiration after ERCP, which yielded a positive diagnosis of cancer in all cases; SEMS did not impair visualization of the tumor mass at EUS. Pancreaticoduodenectomy was undertaken successfully in all 29 patients and the presence of a SEMS did not interfere with biliary anastomosis. On univariate logistic regression, only SEMS placement was associated with less need for endoscopic reintervention (P=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: SEMS are superior to plastic stents for preoperative biliary decompression in pancreatic cancer.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: The genetic factors predisposing individuals with obesity or diabetes to pancreatic cancer have not been identified. AIMS: To investigate the hypothesis that obesity- and diabetes-related genes modify the risk of pancreatic cancer. METHODS: We genotyped 15 single nucleotide polymorphisms of fat mass and obesity-associated (FTO), peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma), nuclear receptor family 5 member 2 (NR5A2), AMPK, and ADIPOQ genes in 1,070 patients with pancreatic cancer and 1,175 cancer-free controls. Information on risk factors was collected by personal interview. Adjusted ORs (AOR) and 95% CIs were calculated using unconditional logistic regression. RESULTS: The PPARgamma P12A GG genotype was inversely associated with risk of pancreatic cancer (AOR, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.07-0.62). Three NR5A2 variants that were previously identified in a genome-wide association study were significantly associated with reduced risk of pancreatic cancer, AORs ranging from 0.57 to 0.79. Two FTO gene variants and one ADIPOQ variant were differentially associated with pancreatic cancer according to levels of body mass index (BMI; P(interaction) = 0.0001, 0.0015, and 0.03). For example, the AOR (95% CI) for FTO IVS1-2777AC/AA genotype was 0.72 (0.55-0.96) and 1.54 (1.14-2.09) in participants with a BMI of less than 25 or 25 kg/m(2) or more, respectively. We observed no significant association between AMPK genotype and pancreatic cancer and no genotype interactions with diabetes or smoking. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest the PPARgamma P12A GG genotype and NR5A2 variants may reduce the risk for pancreatic cancer. A positive association of FTO and ADIPOQ gene variants with pancreatic cancer may be limited to persons who are overweight. IMPACT: The discovery of genetic factors modifying the risk of pancreatic cancer may help to identify high-risk individuals for prevention efforts.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Pancreatic cancer (PC) is one of the most lethal malignant diseases with the worst prognosis. It is ranked as the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States. Many risk factors have been associated with PC. Interestingly, large numbers of epidemiological studies suggest that obesity and diabetes, especially type-2 diabetes, are positively associated with increased risk of PC. Similarly, these chronic diseases (obesity, diabetes, and cancer) are also a major public health concern. In the U.S. population, 50 percent are overweight, 30 percent are medically obese, and 10 percent have diabetes mellitus (DM). Therefore, obesity and DM have been considered as potential risk factors for cancers; however, the focus of this article is restricted to PC. Although the mechanisms responsible for the development of these chronic diseases leading to the development of PC are not fully understood, the biological importance of the activation of insulin, insulin like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and its receptor (IGF-1R) signaling pathways in insulin resistance mechanism and subsequent induction of compensatory hyperinsulinemia has been proposed. Therefore, targeting insulin/IGF-1 signaling with anti-diabetic drugs for lowering blood insulin levels and reversal of insulin resistance could be useful strategy for the prevention and/or treatment of PC. A large number of studies have demonstrated that the administration of anti-diabetic drugs such as metformin and thiazolidinediones (TZD) class of PPAR-gamma agonists decreases the risk of cancers, suggesting that these agents might be useful anti-tumor agents for the treatment of PC. In this review article, we will discuss the potential roles of metformin and TZD anti-diabetic drugs as anti-tumor agents in the context of PC and will further discuss the complexities and the possible roles of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the pathogenesis of obesity, diabetes, and PC.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'CONTEXT: Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is the procedure of choice for biliary decompression in patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer. However, it may be unsuccessful in 3 to 10% of cases. When ERCP is unsuccessful, the usual alternatives are percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage or surgery. Recently, several authors have reported the use of EUS-guided biliary drainage in patients with malignant biliary obstructions, with acceptable success and complication rates. We describe three cases of unresectable pancreatic cancer associated with obstructive jaundice, treated by EUS-guided biliary drainage. CASE REPORT: Three patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer, associated with obstructive jaundice, were included. ERCP was unsuccessful because of complete tumor obstruction of the distal common bile duct and papilla invasion. An EUS-guided rendezvous maneuver was attempted, without success. Then, EUS-guided choledochoduodenostomy, with a partially covered self-expanding metal stent, was performed in the same procedure. There were no early complications and the procedure was also clinically effective in relieving jaundice in all cases. CONCLUSIONS: EUS-guided biliary drainage is a feasible alternative to percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage or surgery in unresectable pancreatic cancer with obstructive jaundice when ERCP fails. However, the development of new specific instruments and studies comparing this procedure with percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage and surgery are needed.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP) is associated with a marked elevation of serum total IgG(4) . Although there is evidence of autoimmunity in AIP, there are also signs of an allergic nature of its pathogenesis. Therefore, we determined both IgE and IgG(4) in 13 patients with AIP, in 12 patients with pancreatic carcinoma and in 14 patients with atopic allergy and investigated the relationship between IgE and IgG(4) . Total IgG(4) was determined by automated nephelometry and total IgE by automated enzyme fluoroimmunoassay. Both total IgE and total IgG(4) levels in patients with AIP were significantly higher than those in patients with pancreatic carcinoma (P = 0.0004 and P = 0.015, respectively). There was a significant correlation between the total IgE and total IgG(4) levels in patients with AIP and patients with atopic allergy (r(s) =0.82, P=0.0006 and r(s) =0.88, P < 0.0001, respectively). The IgE/ IgG(4) ratio in sera from patients with atopic allergy was significantly different (P = 0.0012) from this ratio in sera from patients with AIP. These results suggest that analysis of total IgE in serum might be useful in the differentiation between autoimmune pancreatitis and pancreatic carcinoma.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Z-360 is an orally active cholecystokinin-2 (CCK2)/gastrin receptor antagonist currently under development as a therapeutic drug for pancreatic cancer. It was previously reported that Z-360 treatment in combination with gemcitabine prolonged the survival period in a lethal pancreatic cancer xenograft model in mice. In a phase Ib/IIa clinical study, Z-360 treatment displayed a trend of reduced pain in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer in combination with gemcitabine including analgesics such as opioids. Here, we investigated the mechanism of analgesic action of Z-360 in a severe cancer-induced pain model in mice, which is considered to be opioid-resistant, by examining ephrin B1 gene expression, N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor NR2B subunit phosphorylation, and interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) production. RESULTS: In a mouse model of cancer-induced pain, ephrin B1 gene expression in dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) and the phosphorylation of NR2B in the spinal cord were induced. Z-360 treatment inhibited both ephrin B1 gene expression and the phosphorylation of NR2B. In addition, IL-1beta production increased in the cancer-inoculated hind paw of mice, but could be suppressed by treatment with Z-360. Moreover, we observed that the CCK1 receptor antagonist devazepide similarly suppressed up-regulation of ephrin B1 gene expression and IL-1beta production, and that the intraperitoneal injection of sulfated CCK-8 induced the production of IL-1beta in the cancer-inoculated region. CONCLUSIONS: We have identified a novel pain cascade, in which IL-1beta production in cancer-inoculated regions induces ephrin B1 gene expression in DRGs and then ephrin B1 enhances the tyrosine phosphorylation of NR2B via Eph B receptor in the spinal cord. Notably, Z-360 relieves cancer-induced pain by preventing this pain cascade through the suppression of IL-1beta production, likely via the blockade of CCK1 receptor. The pre-clinical results presented here support the analgesic action of Z-360 in pancreatic cancer patients with severe, opioid-resistant pain. Pre-clinical and clinical results have demonstrated that Z-360 combined with gemcitabine represents a promising pancreatic cancer therapy approach with characteristic analgesic effects in addition to the prolongation of survival.',\n",

       "  'AB': \"PURPOSE: Nutritional status may influence quality of life and prognosis among pancreatic cancer patients, yet few studies describe measures of nutritional status during treatment. We evaluated the nutritional status of locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC) patients undergoing chemoradiotherapy who received baseline nutritional assessment and counseling. METHODS: Fourteen newly diagnosed LAPC patients enrolled in phase I/II trials of capecitabine with concomitant radiotherapy were assessed for baseline clinical nutrition measures (body mass index, albumin, weight loss, total energy, and protein intake). Participants completed the Anorexia/Cachexia Subscale (A/CS) questionnaire at baseline and during the 6 weeks of treatment. We evaluated associations between baseline characteristics and subsequent A/CS scores with linear regression and changes in A/CS were assessed with the paired t test. RESULTS: We observed a statistically significant increase in mean A/CS between baseline [24.9, standard deviation (SD) = 9.7] and end of treatment (29.9, SD = 6.2). Controlling for baseline A/CS score, only weight loss greater than 5% of body weight over 1 month was associated with A/CS scores at 6 weeks (beta = 10.558, standard error = 3.307, p value = 0.009) and mean A/CS scores during the last 3 weeks of treatment (beta = 12.739, standard error = 2.251, p value = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: After 6 weeks of chemoradiotherapy, LAPC patients reported a statistically significant improvement in appetite and weight concerns. Increases in AC/S scores were associated with higher baseline A/CS scores and weight loss of 5% or more during 1 month. Further research is needed to determine the impact of nutritional support during treatment, as improvements in this domain may impact LAPC patients' overall quality of life.\",\n",

       "  'AB': \"BACKGROUND: To investigate the prognostic value of quality of life (QOL) relative to tumour marker carbohydrate antigen (CA) 19-9, and the role of CA 19-9 in estimating palliation in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer receiving chemotherapy. METHODS: CA 19-9 serum concentration was measured at baseline and every 3 weeks in a phase III trial (SAKK 44/00-CECOG/PAN.1.3.001). Patients scored QOL indicators at baseline, and before each administration of chemotherapy (weekly or bi-weekly) for 24 weeks or until progression. Prognostic factors were investigated by Cox models, QOL during chemotherapy by mixed-effect models. RESULTS: Patient-rated pain (P<0.02) and tiredness (P<0.03) were independent predictors for survival, although less prognostic than CA 19-9 (P<0.001). Baseline CA 19-9 did not predict QOL during chemotherapy, except for a marginal effect on pain (P<0.05). Mean changes in physical domains across the whole observation period were marginally correlated with the maximum CA 19-9 decrease. Patients in a better health status reported the most improvement in QOL within 20 days before maximum CA 19-9 decrease. They indicated substantially less pain and better physical well-being, already, early on during chemotherapy with a maximum CA 19-9 decrease of >/=50% vs <50%. CONCLUSION: In advanced pancreatic cancer, pain and tiredness are independent prognostic factors for survival, although less prognostic than CA 19-9. Quality of life improves before best CA 19-9 response but the maximum CA 19-9 decrease has no impact on subsequent QOL. To estimate palliation by chemotherapy, patient's perception needs to be taken into account.\",\n",

       "  'AB': 'PURPOSE: The role of adjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT) in resectable pancreatic cancer is still debated. This randomized phase II intergroup study explores the feasibility and tolerability of a gemcitabine-based CRT regimen after R0 resection of pancreatic head cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Within 8 weeks after surgery, patients were randomly assigned to receive either four cycles of gemcitabine (control arm) or gemcitabine for two cycles followed by weekly gemcitabine with concurrent radiation (50.4 Gy; CRT arm). The primary objective was to exclude a < 60% treatment completion and a > 40% rate of grade 4 hematologic or GI toxicity in the CRT arm with type I and II errors of 10%. Secondary end points were late toxicity, disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: Between September 2004 and January 2007, 90 patients were randomly assigned (45:45). Patient characteristics were similar in both arms. Treatment was completed per protocol by 86.7% and 73.3% (80% CI, 63.1% to 81.9%; 95% CI, 58.1% to 85.4%) in the control and CRT arms, respectively, and grade 4 toxicity was 0% and 4.7% (two of 43; 80% CI, 1.2% to 11.9%), respectively. In the CRT arm, three patients experienced grade 3-related late toxicity. Median DFS was 12 months in the CRT arm and 11 months in the control arm. Median OS was 24 months in both arms. First local recurrence was less frequent in the CRT arm (11% v 24%). CONCLUSION: Adjuvant gemcitabine-based CRT is feasible, well-tolerated, and not deleterious; adding this treatment to full-dose adjuvant gemcitabine after resection of pancreatic cancer should be evaluated in a phase III trial.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Males with pancreatic cancer have decreased survival compared with females. Interestingly, perioperative blood transfusions have been shown to reduce survival in patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Recent evidence incriminates blood transfusions from female donors as a causative factor in acute lung injury. We therefore hypothesize that male mice with pancreatic cancer will have greater tumor progression than female mice in response to transfusion. METHODS: Mice previously inoculated with pancreatic cancer cells received an intravenous injection of acellular plasma collected from single donor erythrocytes from either male or female donors. Control mice received an equal volume of intravenous saline. Necropsy to determine metastasis was performed in female mice at 4 wk status post-transfusion. The male group necessitated sacrifice at 3 wk post-transfusion due to clinical deterioration. RESULTS: Male mice developed more metastatic events than female mice, and this was accentuated when receiving blood from female donors. Male mice experienced weight loss within 2 wk of tail vein injection, and three mice in the male transfused groups died secondary to malignancy. Female mice did not manifest substantial weight loss, and did not die in the study time period. CONCLUSION: Male mice, compared with female, had significantly more metastatic events following transfusion of plasma from stored erythrocytes in an immunocompetent murine model of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Moreover, the adverse effect of transfusion was augmented with female donor blood. These data are consistent with clinical outcomes from centers of excellence in treating pancreatic cancer and warrant further investigation.',\n",

Recently, it has been used to treat different types of malignant carcinoma including intracranial and caudomedial tumors. This study was designed to evaluate the short-term efficacy and toxicity of the CyberKnife radiotherapy for locally advanced pancreatic cancer. METHODS: A total of 20 patients with locally advanced (stage II-III) pancreatic cancer treated with CyberKnife were recruited between April 2009 and December 2009. Of 20 patients, 13 were with cancer located at the pancreatic head and 7 were located at the pancreatic body and tail. The planning target volume (PTV) was defined as gross tumor volume (GTV) plus 2-3 mm, and more than 95% PTV should be covered by 75% isodose surface. The median of PTV was 47 cm(3) (26-64 cm(3)). The median total prescription dose was 40 Gy (32-55 Gy) at 3-6 fractions. During treatment delivery, X-Sight Spine Tracking System was used in 5 patients to track movement of the tumor. Other 15 patients were implanted fiducials in the tumors to track movement of the tumor and patient breathing patterns. RESULTS: The median follow-up time was 7 months (3-11 months). All patients had finished the treatment and 19 were alive by the last follow-up. Slight fatigue was the most common complain. Evaluated by CT scan, 6 were complete response, 9 were partial response, 3 were stable disease, and 1 was progression; 1 was dead. There were 6 patients with grade I granulocytopenia, 7 with grade I nausea, and 5 with grade II vomiting. CONCLUSIONS: The CyberKnife radiosurgery for the locally advanced pancreatic cancer shows a high rate of local control and minimal toxicity. Long-term follow-up is necessary to evaluate the survival and late toxicity.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Higher body-mass index (BMI) has been implicated as a risk factor for developing pancreatic cancer, but its effect on survival has not been thoroughly investigated. The authors assessed the association of BMI with survival in a sample of pancreatic cancer patients and used epidemiologic and clinical information to understand the contribution of diabetes and hyperglycemia. METHODS: A survival analysis using Cox proportional hazards by usual adult BMI was performed on 1861 unselected patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma; analyses were adjusted for covariates that included clinical stage, age, and sex. Secondary analyses incorporated self-reported diabetes and fasting blood glucose in the survival model. RESULTS: BMI as a continuous variable was inversely associated with survival from pancreatic adenocarcinoma (hazard ratio [HR], 1.019 for each increased unit of BMI [kg/m2], P<.001) after adjustment for age, stage, and sex. In analysis by National Institutes of Health BMI category, BMIs of 30 to 34.99 kg/m2 (HR, 1.14; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.98-1.33), 35 to 39.99 kg/m2 (HR 1.32, 95% CI 1.08-1.62), and >/=40 (HR 1.60, 95% CI 1.26-2.04) were associated with decreased survival compared with normal BMI of 18.5 to 24.99 kg/m2 (overall trend test P<.001). Fasting blood glucose and diabetes did not affect the results. CONCLUSIONS: Higher BMI is associated with decreased survival in pancreatic cancer. Although the mechanism of this association remains undetermined, diabetes and hyperglycemia do not appear to account for the observed association.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a highly lethal disease with complex etiology involving both environmental and genetic factors. Although cigarette smoking is known to explain 25% of cases, data from recent studies suggest that obesity and long-term type II diabetes are two major modifiable risk factors for PC. Furthermore, obesity and diabetes seem to affect the clinical outcome of patients with PC. Understanding the mechanistic effects of obesity and diabetes on the pancreas may identify new strategies for prevention or therapy. Experimental and epidemiologic evidence suggests that the antidiabetic drug metformin has protective antitumor activity in PC. In addition to insulin resistance and inflammation as mechanisms of carcinogenesis, obesity and diabetes are linked to impairments in endothelial function and coagulation status, which increase the risks of thrombosis and angiogenesis and, in turn, the risk of PC development and progression. The associations of the ABO blood group gene and NR5A2 gene variants with PC discovered by recent genome-wide association studies may link insulin resistance, inflammation, and thrombosis to pancreatic carcinogenesis. These exciting findings open new avenues for understanding the etiology of PC and provide opportunities for developing novel strategies for prevention and treatment of this disease.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Pancreatic cancer is a highly aggressive malignancy, and improvement in systemic therapy is necessary to treat this frequently encountered metastatic disease. The current targeted agents used in combination with gemcitabine improved objective response rates, but with little or no improvements in survival and also increased toxicities in pancreatic cancer patients. Recently, we showed that the triterpenoid cucurbitacin B inhibited tumour growth in pancreatic cancer cells by inhibition of the JAK/STAT pathway, and synergistically increased antiproliferative effects of gemcitabine in vitro. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: The anti-tumour effects and toxicities of cucurbitacin B in combination with gemcitabine were tested against human pancreatic cancer cells in a murine xenograft model. KEY RESULTS: Combined therapy with cucurbitacin B and gemcitabine at relatively low doses (0.5 mg x kg(-1) and 25 mg x kg(-1) respectively) resulted in highly significant tumour growth inhibition of pancreatic cancer xenografts (up to 79%). Remarkably, this therapy was well tolerated by the animals, as shown by histology of visceral organs, analysis of serum chemistry, full blood counts and bone marrow colony numbers. Western blot analysis of the tumour samples of mice who received both cucurbitacin B and gemcitabine, revealed stronger inhibition of Bcl-XL, Bcl-2 and c-myc, and higher activation of the caspase cascades, than mice treated with either agent alone. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Combination of cucurbitacin B and gemcitabine had profound anti-proliferative effects in vivo against xenografts of human pancreatic cancer cells, without any significant signs of toxicity. This promising combination should be examined in therapeutic trials of pancreatic cancer.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Obesity has been proposed as a risk factor for pancreatic cancer. METHODS: Pooled data were analyzed from the National Cancer Institute Pancreatic Cancer Cohort Consortium (PanScan) to study the association between prediagnostic anthropometric measures and risk of pancreatic cancer. PanScan applied a nested case-control study design and included 2170 cases and 2209 control subjects. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using unconditional logistic regression for cohort-specific quartiles of body mass index (BMI [calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared]), weight, height, waist circumference, and waist to hip ratio as well as conventional BMI categories (underweight, <18.5; normal weight, 18.5-24.9; overweight, 25.0-29.9; obese, 30.0-34.9; and severely obese, > or = 35.0). Models were adjusted for potential confounders. RESULTS: In all of the participants, a positive association between increasing BMI and risk of pancreatic cancer was observed (adjusted OR for the highest vs lowest BMI quartile, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.12-1.58; P(trend) < .001). In men, the adjusted OR for pancreatic cancer for the highest vs lowest quartile of BMI was 1.33 (95% CI, 1.04-1.69; P(trend) < .03), and in women it was 1.34 (95% CI, 1.05-1.70; P(trend) = .01). Increased waist to hip ratio was associated with increased risk of pancreatic cancer in women (adjusted OR for the highest vs lowest quartile, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.31-2.69; P(trend) = .003) but less so in men. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide strong support for a positive association between BMI and pancreatic cancer risk. In addition, centralized fat distribution may increase pancreatic cancer risk, especially in women.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Cachexia is a common problem in patients (pts) suffering from upper gastrointestinal cancer. In addition, most of these patients suffer from malabsorption and stenosis of the gastrointestinal tract due to their illness. Various methods of supplementary nutrition (enteral, parenteral) are practised. In patients with advanced pancreatic cancer (APC), phase angle, determined by bio-electrical impedance analysis (BIA), seems to be a survival predictor. The positive influence of BIA determinate predictors by additional nutrition is currently under discussion. METHODS: To examine the impact of additional parenteral nutrition (APN) we assessed outpatients suffering from APC and progressive cachexia. The assessment based on the BIA method. Assessment parameters were phase angle, ECM/BCM index (ratio of extracellular mass to body cell mass), and BMI (body mass index). Patients suffering from progressive weight loss in spite of additional enteral nutritional support were eligible for the study. RESULTS: Median treatment duration in 32 pts was 18 [8-35] weeks. Response evaluation showed a benefit in 27 pts (84%) in at least one parameter. 14 pts (43.7%) improved or stabilised in all three parameters. The median ECM/BCM index was 1.7 [1.11-3.14] at start of APN and improved down to 1.5 [1.12-3.36] during therapy. The median BMI increased from 19.7 [14.4-25.9] to 20.5 [15.4-25.0]. The median phase angle improved by 10% from 3.6 [2.3-5.1] to 3.9 [2.2-5.1]. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated the positive impact of APN on the assessed parameters, first of all the phase angle, and we observed at least a temporary benefit or stabilisation of the nutritional status in the majority of the investigated patients. Based on these findings we are currently investigating the impact of APN on survival in a larger patient cohort. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00919659.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Oxaliplatin, a third generation of platinum-based anti-neoplastic agent has been approved for colorectal cancer in both adjuvant and metastatic settings. In addition, oxaliplatin is also indicated for other gastrointestinal malignancies such as metastatic pancreatic cancer in combination with gemcitabine. Its common toxicities include infusional hypersensitivity reaction (HSR), GI symptoms with anorexia/nausea/vomiting, sensory neuropathy and bone marrow suppression. We report a case with persistent dry cough as a variant HSR to oxaliplatin. The patient is a 75-year-old gentleman with gemcitabine refractory metastatic pancreatic cancer who received oxaliplatin and mitomycin C for palliation. He developed sudden onset dry cough without infectious etiology during the 4th infusion of oxaliplatin. Robitussin with codeine and antibiotics did not offer any relief and the cough terminated after cessation of oxaliplatin for two weeks. We believe this to be the first case in the literature with cough as a sole manifestation of HSR to oxaliplatin.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Mithramycin (MIT) and tolfenamic acid (TA) inhibit the activity of the transcription factor Sp1. In the present study, we investigated whether pancreatic cancer treatment with a combination of these compounds has a synergistic effect on Sp1 activity, tumor growth, and their underlying response mechanisms. Treatment of pancreatic tumor xenografts with MIT and TA produced dose-dependent antitumor activity, and significant antitumor activity of either compound alone was directly associated with systemic side effects. Combination treatment with nontoxic doses of both compounds produced synergistic antitumor activity, whereas treatment with a nontoxic dose of either compound alone lacked a discernible antitumor effect. Synergistic therapeutic effects correlated directly with synergistic antiproliferation and antiangiogenesis in vitro. Moreover, combination treatment resulted in Sp1 protein degradation, drastically downregulating expression of Sp1 and vascular endothelial growth factor. Our findings established that Sp1 is a critical target of TA and MIT in human pancreatic cancer therapy, rationalizing clinical studies to determine the effect of existing pancreatic cancer therapy regimens on Sp1 signaling in tumors and normal pancreatic tissue, and the ability of Sp1-targeting strategies to modify cancer responses.',\n",

He is alive and well 78 months after initial presentation. Three additional pancreatic cancer case studies are presented in this article. At the time of this writing, the first patient, GB, is alive and well 39 months after presenting with adenocarcinoma of the pancreas with metastases to the liver. The second patient, JK, who presented to the clinic with the same diagnosis was treated with the ALA/N protocol and after 5 months of therapy, PET scan demonstrated no evidence of disease. The third patient, RC, in addition to his pancreatic cancer with liver and retroperitoneal metastases, has a history of B-cell lymphoma and prostate adenocarcinoma. After 4 months of the ALA/N protocol his PET scan demonstrated no signs of cancer. In this article, the authors discuss the poly activity of ALA: as an agent that reduces oxidative stress, its ability to stabilize NF(k)B, its ability to stimulate pro-oxidant apoptosic activity, and its discriminative ability to discourage the proliferation of malignant cells. In addition, the ability of lowdose naltrexone to modulate an endogenous immune response is discussed. This is the second article published on the ALA/N protocol and the authors believe the protocol warrants clinical trial.',\n",

Smoking, diabetes, and family history might explain some of this disparity, but prospective analyses are warranted. From 1984 to 2004, there were 6,243 pancreatic cancer deaths among Blacks (n = 48,525) and Whites (n = 1,011,864) in the Cancer Prevention Study II cohort. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models yielded hazards ratios (HR) for known and suspected risk factors. Population attributable risks were computed and their effect on age-standardized mortality rates were evaluated. Blacks in this cohort had a 42% increased risk of pancreatic cancer mortality compared with Whites (HR, 1.42; 95% confidence intervals (CI), 1.28-1.58). Current smoking increased risk by >60% in both races; although Blacks smoked less intensely, risks were similar to Whites (HR(Black), 1.67; 95% CI, 1.28-2.18; HR(White), 1.82; 95% CI, 1.7-1.95). Obesity was significantly associated with pancreatic cancer mortality in Black men (HR, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.05-2.63), White men (HR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.25-1.60), and White women (HR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.22-1.54); results were null in Black women. The population attributable risk due to smoking, family history, diabetes, cholecystectomy, and overweight/obesity was 24.3% in Whites and 21.8% in Blacks. Smoking and overweight/obesity play a substantial a role in pancreatic cancer. Variation in the effect of these factors underscores the need to evaluate disease on the race-sex level. The inability to attribute excess disease in Blacks to currently known risk factors, even when combined with suspected risks, points to yet undetermined factors that play a role in the disease process.',\n",

       "  'AB': \"BACKGROUND: Dramatic weight loss is an often underestimated symptom in pancreatic cancer patients. Cachexia- defined as an unintended loss of stable weight exceeding 10%--is present in up to 80% of patients with cancer of the upper gastrointestinal tract, and has a significant influence on survival. The aim of the study was to show the multiple systemic effects of cachexia in pancreatic cancer patients, in terms of resection rate, effects on pulmonary function, amount of fat and muscle tissue, as well as changes in laboratory parameters. METHODS: In patients with pancreatic cancer, clinical appearance was documented, including the amount of weight loss. Laboratory parameters and lung-function tests were evaluated, and the thickness of muscle and fat tissue was measured with computed tomography scans. Statistical analysis, including multivariate analysis, was performed using SPSS software. Survival curves were calculated using Kaplan-Meier analysis and the log-rank test. To test for significant differences between the examined groups we used Student's t-test and the Mann-Whitney U test. Significance was defined as p < 0.05. RESULTS: Of 198 patients with a ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas, 70% were suffering from weight loss when they presented for operation, and in 40% weight loss exceeded 10% of the stable weight. In patients with cachexia, metastases were diagnosed significantly more often (47% vs. 24%, P < 0.001), leading to a significantly reduced resection rate in these patients. Patients with cachexia had significantly reduced fat tissue amounts. Hence, dramatic weight loss in a patient with pancreatic cancer may be a hint of a more progressed or more aggressive tumour. CONCLUSION: Pancreatic cancer patients with cachexia had a higher rate of more progressed tumour stages and a worse nutritional status. Furthermore, patients with cachexia had an impaired lung function and a reduction in fat tissue. Patients with pancreatic cancer and cachexia had significantly reduced survival. If weight loss exceeded 5% there was a significantly reduced resection rate to detect, but the changes were significantly more substantial if weight loss was 10% or more. We propose that a weight loss of 10% be defined as significant in pancreatic cancer.\",\n",

       "  'AB': \"CONTEXT: Obesity has been implicated as a risk factor for pancreatic cancer. OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the association of excess body weight across an age cohort and the risk, age of onset, and overall survival of patients with pancreatic cancer. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A case-control study of 841 patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma and 754 healthy individuals frequency matched by age, race, and sex. The study was conducted at a university cancer center in the United States from 2004 to 2008. Height and body weight histories were collected by personal interview starting at ages 14 to 19 years and over 10-year intervals progressing to the year prior to recruitment in the study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The associations between patients' body mass index (BMI) and risk of pancreatic cancer, age at onset, and overall survival were examined by unconditional logistic regression, linear regression, and Cox proportional hazard regression models, respectively. RESULTS: Individuals who were overweight (a BMI of 25-29.9) from the ages of 14 to 39 years (highest odds ratio [OR], 1.67; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.20-2.34) or obese (a BMI > or = 30) from the ages of 20 to 49 years (highest OR, 2.58; 95% CI, 1.70-3.90) had an associated increased risk of pancreatic cancer, independent of diabetes status. The association was stronger in men (adjusted OR, 1.80; 95% CI, 1.45-2.23) by mean BMI from the ages of 14 to 59 years than in women (adjusted OR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.02-1.70) and in ever smokers (adjusted OR, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.37-2.22) than in never smokers (adjusted OR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.16-1.84). The population-attributable risk percentage of pancreatic cancer based on the mean BMI from the ages of 14 to 59 years was 10.3% for never smokers and 21.3% for ever smokers. Individuals who were overweight or obese from the ages of 20 to 49 years had an earlier onset of pancreatic cancer by 2 to 6 years (median age of onset was 64 years for patients with normal weight, 61 years for overweight patients [P = .02], and 59 years for obese patients [P < .001]). Compared with those with normal body weight and after adjusting for all clinical factors, individuals who were overweight or obese from the ages of 30 to 79 years or in the year prior to recruitment had reduced overall survival of pancreatic cancer regardless of disease stage and tumor resection status (overweight patients: hazard ratio, 1.26 [95% CI, 0.94-1.69], P = .04; obese patients: hazard ratio, 1.86 [95% CI, 1.35-2.56], P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Overweight or obesity during early adulthood was associated with a greater risk of pancreatic cancer and a younger age of disease onset. Obesity at an older age was associated with a lower overall survival in patients with pancreatic cancer.\",\n",

Here a case history is presented to highlight a pancreatic cancer patient on bevacizumab chemotherapy who developed empyema as the first manifestation of gastric perforation. This unusual presentation warns physicians that bevacizumab-related bowel perforation can arise as a thoracic complication, without typical gastrointestinal manifestations, in an advanced cancer patient.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND/AIMS: Hereditary pancreatic cancer comprises about 10% of pancreatic cancer cases. Multiple causative mutations have been identified. Here we describe a pancreatitis/pancreatic cancer (P/PC) family, which demonstrates pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer resulting from an uncharacterized mutation. METHODS: Family members completed evaluations to determine signs of mutation status. Select patients were screened for mutations associated with hereditary pancreatic diseases. RESULTS: In generation II, 12 siblings exhibit 6 cases of pancreatitis, 3 pancreatic cancer, and 2 obligate carrier status. The average age at pancreatitis diagnosis of enrolled members is 32.5 years; average age at pancreatic cancer diagnosis is 59 years. There is no association with known cancer syndromes. Those affected generally present with mild epigastric pain, and CT scans demonstrate characteristic fatty infiltration of the pancreatic body and tail with sparing of the head and neck. Full sequence analysis of genes associated with hereditary pancreatic disease failed to demonstrate known mutations or polymorphisms. CONCLUSION: Based upon pedigree evaluation and preliminary DNA analysis, we believe that the family members with P/PC carry a novel genetic mutation resulting in hereditary pancreatitis. This mutation is autosomal dominant, expressed with high penetrance, and is part of a unique hereditary syndrome that significantly increases pancreatic cancer risk.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Obesity and insulin resistance have been implicated in the etiology of pancreatic cancer (PC). Whether adiponectin and/or leptin, two adipocyte-secreted hormones important in metabolic regulation, are associated with PC pathogenesis and whether adiponectin receptors are expressed in PC remains unknown. In a hospital-based case-control study, we studied 81 cases with incident, histologically confirmed PC and 81 controls matched on gender and age between 2000 and 2007 to investigate the role of adiponectin and leptin adjusting for risk factors linked to PC. In a separate study, we also studied for the first time whether adiponectin receptors 1 and 2 are expressed in PC by studying 16 PC tumor tissue samples which were analyzed using immunohistochemistry. When subjects were divided into control-defined quartiles of adiponectin and leptin, lower leptin but higher adiponectin levels were associated with PC (p = 0.001 and p = 0.05 respectively) before and after controlling for age, gender, BMI, smoking status, alcohol consumption, history of diabetes, and family history of pancreatic cancer. Of the PC tumor tissue samples analyzed, 87.5% had positive or strong positive expression of AdipoR1 and 93.7% had positive or strong positive expression of AdipoR2. Further prospective studies are needed to determine whether the elevated adiponectin and low leptin levels reported in this study reflect compensatory changes during PC progression and thus can be used as markers for PC or whether they are causally implicated in PC.',\n",

METHODS: The clinical and ultrasonic characteristics of 12 cases of pancreatic lymphoma and 30 cases of pancreatic cancer were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: Statistically significant differences were found in the course of disease, back pain, jaundice, carcino-embryonic antigen (CEA) and CA19-9 increase, palpable abdominal lump, superficial lymph node enlargement, fever and night sweats, lesion size, bile duct expansion, pancreatic duct expansion, vascular involvement, retroperitoneal (below the renal vein level) lymph node enlargement, and intrahepatic metastasis between pancreatic lymphoma and pancreatic cancer. There were no significant differences in age of onset, gender ratio, weight loss, nausea and vomiting, lesion position, the echo of the lesion, and the blood flow of the lesion. CONCLUSION: Pancreatic lymphoma should be considered for patients with long lasting symptoms, superficial lymph node enlargement, palpable abdominal lump, fever and night sweats, relatively large lesions, and retroperitoneal (below the level of the renal vein) lymph node enlargement. A diagnosis of pancreatic cancer should be considered more likely in the patients with relatively short disease course, jaundice, back pain, CEA and CA19-9 increase, relatively small lesions, bile duct expansion, obvious pancreatic duct expansion, peripheral vascular wrapping and involvement, or intrahepatic metastases.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study comparing gemcitabine+tipifarnib (G+t) or gemcitabine+placebo (G+p) in patients with pancreatic cancer, the primary endpoint of time to deterioration (TTD) was based primarily on patient-reported outcomes. Deterioration was defined as death or worsening of disease-related symptoms, based on patient-reported outcomes of pain intensity and analgesic use in a daily diary, plus investigator-rated weekly performance status. Secondary endpoints included survival and safety. Two hundred and forty-four patients were treated for a total of 4780 weeks, during which the diary was completed daily. Overall, the completion of the diary was found to be feasible: patients completed approximately 95% of scheduled diary entries. Baseline characteristics were well balanced between the two treatment arms. The primary endpoint of TTD was not significantly different between the G+t arm (69 days) and the G+p arm (91 days, P=0.40). Survival was not significantly different between the G+t arm (202 days) and the G+p arm (221 days, P=0.66). The combination of G+t had an acceptable toxicity profile, with primarily neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. Methodologically, measurement of patient-reported outcomes is feasible and useful in assessing the effect of anti-cancer therapy in pancreatic cancer if comprehensive initial and ongoing training is provided to all people involved, including not only the patients but also the study personnel.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: An accurate pre-therapeutic assessment of the resectability in pancreatic cancer patients is essential to reduce the number of futile surgical explorations. The aim of this study was to assess the combination of endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and laparoscopic ultrasound (LUS) regarding the detection of patients with non-resectable tumours. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From 2002 to 2004, 179 consecutive patients with pancreatic cancer referred for surgical treatment were eligible. Thirty-one (17%) patients were excluded due to co-morbidity and poor performance status. Two patients (1%) were excluded due to metastasis seen on CT scans prior to referral. Thus, 146 patients entered the study. Patients were first examined with EUS followed by LUS, if EUS found no signs of non-resectability. Only patients with tumours found to be resectable or possibly resectable at EUS and LUS were offered surgical treatment. Resectability criteria were defined prior to the study. RESULTS: In all, 108 (74%) patients had non-resectable tumours by the pre-defined criteria. EUS identified 68 (63%) patients and LUS identified an additional 26 (24%) patients. Thus, a total of 94 (87%) patients were non-resectable at either EUS or LUS. Fifty-two (36%) patients underwent surgery. Six patients had surgical exploration and three patients had palliative surgery. Forty-three patients (29%) were resected with curative intention, of whom 38 (88%) had an R0 resection and 5 (12%) had a palliative resection. DISCUSSION: The combination of EUS and LUS is accurate in identifying the non-resectable patients and has a high predictive value for complete resection.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: Gemcitabine (GEM) is efficient in treating advanced pancreatic cancer. Preliminary clinical studies showed that the efficacy of gemcitabine combined oxaliplatin (GEMOX regimen) is better than that of gemcitabine alone. But in China, the use of GEMOX regimen for advance pancreatic cancer has seldom been reported. This study was to analyze the efficacy of GEMOX regimen on advanced pancreatic cancer, and observe the adverse events. METHODS: Clinical data of 32 chemonaive patients with stage III-IV pancreatic cancer, treated with GEMOX regimen [intravenous injection of gemcitabine (1 000 mg/m(2)) at Day 1 and Day 8, and intravenous injection of oxaliplatin (85-130 mg/m(2)) at Day 1; repeated every 21 days] at Cancer Center of Sun Yat-sen University from Feb. 2001 to Jun. 2006, were reviewed. RESULTS: Of the 32 patients, 8 achieved partial remission (PR), 8 had stable disease (SD), and 12 had progressive disease (PD)u the objective responses were not assessable (NA) in 4 patients. The response rate was 25.0%, and the clinical benefit response (CBR) rate was 46.9% (15 patients). The progression-free survival (PFS) was 4.7 months; the median overall survival was 8.6 months; the 1-year survival rate was 32.6%. The total occurrence rate of myelosuppression was 70.9%u the occurrence rate of grade III-IV myelosuppression was 32.3%: 12.9% for anemia, 19.4% for neutropenia, and 22.6% for thrombocytopenia. The occurrence rate of gastrointestinal adverse events was 56.2%u only 2 patients had grade III vomiting. Liver function damage (grade I-II) occurred in 8 (25.0%) patients; peripheral neurotoxicity (grade I) occurred in 14 (43.8%) patients. No chemotherapy-related death occurred. CONCLUSIONS: GEMOX is an effective regimen for pancreatic carcinoma with good clinical tolerance. The main adverse event is myelosuppression.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Cannabinoids exert antiproliferative properties in a variety of malignant tumors, including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). In our study, we quantitatively evaluated the immunoreactivity for cannabinoid-1 (CB1) and cannabinoid-2 (CB2) receptors as well as for the endocannabinoid metabolizing enzymes fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) and monoacyl glycerol lipase (MGLL). Furthermore, quantitative real-time RT-PCR for CB1, CB2, FAAH and MGLL in normal pancreas and pancreatic cancer tissues was performed. Levels of endocannabinoids were determined by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. Immunoreactivity scores and QRT-PCR expression levels were correlated with the clinico-pathological (TNM, survival, pain) status of the patients. Evaluation of endocannabinoid levels revealed that these remained unchanged in PDAC compared to the normal pancreas. Patients with high CB1 receptor levels in enlarged nerves in PDAC had a lower combined pain score (intensity, frequency, duration; p = 0.012). There was a significant relationship between low CB1 receptor immunoreactivity or mRNA expression levels (p = 0.0011 and p = 0.026, respectively), or high FAAH and MGLL cancer cell immunoreactivity (p = 0.036 and p = 0.017, respectively) and longer survival of PDAC patients. These results are underlined by a significant correlation of high pain scores and increased survival (p = 0.0343). CB2 receptor immunoreactivity, CB2 receptor, FAAH and MGLL mRNA expression levels did not correlate with survival. Therefore, changes in the levels of endocannabinoid metabolizing enzymes and cannabinoid receptors on pancreatic cancer cells may affect prognosis and pain status of PDAC patients.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Pain is a common symptom of pancreatic disease and is frequently difficult to manage. Pain relief provided by narcotics is often suboptimal and is associated with significant side effects. An alternative approach to pain management in pancreatic disease is the use of celiac plexus block (CPB) or neurolysis (CPN). Originally performed by anesthesiologists and radiologists via a posterior approach, recent advances in endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) have made this technique an attractive alternative. EUS guided celiac plexus block/neurolysis is simple to perform and avoids serious complications such as paraplegia or pneumothorax that are associated with the posterior approach. EUS guided CPN should be considered first line therapy in patients with pain due to pancreatic cancer. It provides superior pain control compared to traditional management with narcotics. A trend for improved survival in pancreatic cancer patients treated with CPN has been reported, but larger studies are needed to confirm this finding. At this time, the use of EUS guided CPB cannot be recommended as routine therapy for pain in chronic pancreatitis since only one-half of the patients experience pain reduction and the beneficial effect tends to be short lived. EUS guided CPB and CPN should be used as part of a multidisciplinary team approach for pain management.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'There is accumulating evidence demonstrating that HIF-1 functions as a key regulator of the adaptation responses to hypoxia in cancer tissues. To this evidence, we add that adaptation responses to glucose deprivation plus hypoxia are also necessary for the survival of tumor cells in the tumor microenvironment as cancer tissues are exposed to glucose deprivation as well as hypoxia. We found that adrenomedullin (AM), VEGF, Glut-1, Glut-3, and Hexokinase-2 among 45 hypoxia-inducible genes investigated were expressed at higher levels under glucose-deprived hypoxic conditions than under hypoxic conditions. Glucose deprivation activated the AMPK under normoxia and hypoxia. Compound C, an inhibitor of AMPK, suppressed the expressions of AM and VEGF which had already been enhanced under glucose-deprived hypoxic conditions. siRNAs for both AMPKalpha1 and AMPKalpha2 suppressed the expressions of AM and VEGF. HIF-1alpha protein level and the transcriptional activity of HIF-1 under glucose-deprived hypoxic conditions were thus found to be similar to those under hypoxic conditions. Furthermore, tumor cells in 15 out of 20 human pancreatic cancer tissue specimens were stained by anti-phospho-AMPKalpha antibody. Our results thus suggest that the enhanced expressions of those genes mediated by the activation of AMPK and HIF-1 therefore play a pivotal role in the tumor formation of pancreatic cancers.',\n",

Although shown to prolong survival, there is little information about treatment-related symptoms or the palliative benefits of chemoradiation. We assessed symptoms of patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer receiving chemoradiation to determine the prevalence, and co-occurrence, of symptoms and to identify the extent to which symptoms interfered with function. Forty-eight patients were treated with chemoradiation on a Phase I protocol. Patients received radiotherapy (50.4 Gy in 28 fractions), capecitabine (median dose 825 mg/m(2) twice daily), and bevacizumab (2.5-10 mg/kg). Symptom severity and its interference with function were prospectively assessed (at presentation, during, and after chemoradiation) in 43 consenting patients using the M.D. Anderson Symptom Inventory. Results showed that 95% of patients reported at least one of the 13 symptoms assessed at presentation. The most commonly reported symptoms of moderate to severe (>or=5 on a 0-10 scale) intensity at presentation were lack of appetite (24%), pain (19%), fatigue (19%), and sleep disturbance (10%). We observed an increase in patients reporting moderate to severe fatigue, nausea, and sleep disturbance during chemoradiation. McNemar tests for paired binary observations showed the proportion of patients reporting moderate to severe symptoms significantly (P<0.001) decreased after chemoradiation at 94 days follow-up (lack of appetite=7%, pain=7%, fatigue=13%, sleep disturbance=7%). This study demonstrates the feasibility and usefulness of symptom assessment in chemoradiation protocols. Future studies with larger cohorts are needed to further characterize multiple symptoms associated with chemoradiation.',\n",

PATIENTS AND METHODS: From January 1994 to January 2006, 5-fluorouracil 1,000 mg/m2, leucovorin 100 mg/m2, epirubicin 60 mg/m2 and carboplatin 300 mg/m2 were administered every 3 weeks into the celiac axis (CA) angiografically (FLEC regimen) to 211 patients with UPC. RESULTS: Seven hundred and sixty-four cycles were administered. Grade 3-4 hematological toxicity was observed in 24%; ematemesis in 4%; grade 3 gastrointestinal toxicity in 3%; grade 3 alopecia in 15%. One sudden death, a pre-infarction angina and a transitory ischemic attack were observed. No complications related to the angiographic procedure took place, but three tunica intima dissections of the iliac artery occurred; 7.6% of patients with partial responses and 50.7% with stable disease were observed. Two hundred and one patients have died; median overall survival was 9.2 months: 10.5 and 6.6 for stage III and IV, respectively. CONCLUSION: The FLEC regimen given intra-arterially is well-tolerated and effective in patients with UPC.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'AIM: To assess optimum endoscopic biliary drainage (EBD) in cases with unresectable pancreatic cancer in the era of gemcitabine (GEM). METHODS: Thirty patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer, who presented with jaundice and underwent chemotherapy using GEM after EBD were included in this study (GEM group). Fifteen cases with the same clinical manifestation and stage of pancreatic cancer treated with EBD alone were also included as controls. A covered metallic stent (CMS) or a plastic stent (PS) was used for EBD. The mean survival time (MST) in each group, risk factors of survival time, type of stent used and associated survival time, occlusion rate of stent, patency period of stent, and risk factors of stent occlusion were evaluated. RESULTS: MST in the GEM group was longer than that in the control (9.9 mo vs 6.2 mo). In the GEM group, the survival time was not different between those who underwent metallic stenting and those who underwent plastic stenting. Stent occlusion occurred in 60% of the PS group and 7% of the CMS group. The median stent patency in the PS-GEM group and the CMS-GEM group was 5 mo and 7.5 mo, respectively. Use of a PS was the only risk factor of stent occlusion. CONCLUSION: A CMS is recommended in cases presenting with jaundice due to unresectable pancreatic cancer, since the use of a CMS makes it possible to continue chemotherapy using GEM without repetition of stent replacement.',\n",

       "  'PG': '688-97',\n",
       "  'AB': '[6]-Gingerol, a major phenolic compound derived from ginger, has anti-bacterial, anti-inflammatory and anti-tumor activities. While several molecular mechanisms have been described to underlie its effects on cells in vitro and in vivo, the underlying mechanisms by which [6]-gingerol exerts anti-tumorigenic effects are largely unknown. The purpose of this study was to investigate the action of [6]-gingerol on two human pancreatic cancer cell lines, HPAC expressing wild- type (wt) p53 and BxPC-3 expressing mutated p53. We found that [6]-gingerol inhibited the cell growth through cell cycle arrest at G1 phase in both cell lines. Western blot analyses indicated that [6]-gingerol decreased both Cyclin A and Cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) expression. These events led to reduction in Rb phosphorylation followed by blocking of S phase entry. p53 expression was decreased by [6]-gingerol treatment in both cell lines suggesting that the induction of Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p21cip1, was p53-independent. [6]-Gingerol induced mostly apoptotic death in the mutant p53-expressing cells, while no signs of early apoptosis were detected in wild type p53-expressing cells and this was related to the increased phosphorylation of AKT. These results suggest that [6]-gingerol can circumvent the resistance of mutant p53- expressing cells towards chemotherapy by inducing apoptotic cell death while it exerts cytostatic effect on wild type p53- expressing cells by inducing temporal growth arrest.',\n",

It has been reported that serum IgG4 concentrations are significantly elevated and particularly high (>135 mg/dL) in autoimmune pancreatitis. Measurement of serum IgG4 has become a useful tool for differentiating between autoimmune pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer. However, we present a 74-year-old female with a markedly elevated serum IgG4 (433 mg/dL) who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy for pancreatic cancer. Elevated serum IgG4 levels continued after the resection. On histology, adenocarcinoma of the pancreas accompanied with moderate lymphoplasmacytic infiltration infiltrated the lower bile duct and duodenum, but there were no findings of autoimmune pancreatitis. Although a small metastasis was detected in one parapancreatic lymph node, regional lymph nodes were swollen. Abundant IgG4-positive plasma cells infiltrated the cancerous areas of the pancreas, but only a few IgG4-positive plasma cells were detected in the noncancerous areas. Pancreatic cancer cells were not immunoreactive for IgG4. An abundant infiltration of IgG4-positive plasma cells was detected in the swollen regional lymph nodes and in the duodenal mucosa. We believe that the serum IgG4 level was elevated in this patient with pancreatic cancer as the result of an IgG4-related systemic disease that had no clinical manifestations other than lymphadenopathy.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND & AIMS: The endogenous opioid system is involved in modulating the experience of pain, the response to stress, and the action of analgesic therapies. Recent human imaging studies have shown a significant tonic modulation of visceral pain, raising the question of whether endogenous opioids tonically modulate the pain of visceral cancer. METHODS: Transgenic mice expressing the first 127 amino acids of simian virus 40 large T antigen, under the control of the rat elastase-1 promoter, that spontaneously develop pancreatic cancer were used to investigate the role of endogenous opioids in the modulation of pancreatic cancer pain. Visceral pain behaviors were assessed as degree of hunching and vocalization. RESULTS: Although mice with late-stage pancreatic cancer displayed spontaneous, morphine-reversible, visceral pain-related behaviors such as hunching and vocalization, these behaviors were absent in mice with early-stage pancreatic cancer. After systemic administration of the central nervous system (CNS)-penetrant opioid receptor antagonists naloxone or naltrexone, mice with early-stage pancreatic cancer displayed significant visceral pain-related behaviors, whereas systemic administration of the CNS-nonpenetrant opioid antagonist naloxone-methiodide did not induce an increase in visceral pain behaviors. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that a CNS opioid-dependent mechanism tonically modulates early and late-stage pancreatic cancer pain. Understanding the mechanisms that mask this pain in early stage disease and drive this pain in late-stage disease may allow improved diagnosis, treatment, and care of patients with pancreatic cancer.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'OBJECTIVE: To analyze the role of Artemin in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) in terms of expression, influence on cancer cell behavior, and pain correlation. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: PDAC is characterized by prominent local nerve alterations and perineural invasion, which frequently affects the extrapancreatic nerve plexus, causing severe pain and precluding curative resection. Artemin, a neurotrophic protein controlling growth, regeneration, and survival of neurons was analyzed to highlight the neuro-cancer interactions in PDAC. METHODS: Artemin and its receptors (GFRalpha3/RET) were studied in PDAC tissues and normal pancreas by Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry. RNA expression was analyzed in pancreatic tissues (normal, cancer) and pancreatic cancer cell lines by QRT-PCR. To evaluate whether Artemin influences cancer cell proliferation and invasion, MTT-growth and Matrigel-invasion assays were used. In addition, the tissue expression of Artemin was correlated with pain in PDAC. RESULTS: Artemin and GFRalpha3/RET were both detected at enhanced levels in PDAC compared with normal pancreas, localizing predominantly in hypertrophic nerves and arterial walls, as well as in cancer cells of primary and metastatic lesions. The levels of Artemin and GFRalpha3 did not correlate with pain in PDAC patients. However, Artemin promoted pancreatic cancer cell invasion up to 5-fold, without affecting cancer cell proliferation. CONCLUSION: Artemin expression was not associated with pain in PDAC. However by increasing cancer cell invasion, Artemin seems to influence neural invasion and thereby contribute to cancer cell spreading along pancreatic nerves.',\n",

OBJECTIVE: This article discusses the current management of pancreatic cancer, both potentially curative and palliative treatment. DISCUSSION: Surgical resection of the primary tumour is only possible in about 10% of cases as many patients have locally advanced or metastatic disease at the time of presentation. For the majority of patients, treatment is palliative and may include surgical treatments or endoscopic or percutaneous stenting to relieve obstructive jaundice or gastric obstruction, chemotherapy, radiotherapy or interventional radiological techniques. Adequate pain relief and treatment of pancreatic insufficiency are important components of treatment.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Success of chemotherapy and alleviation of pain are frequently less than optimal in pancreatic cancer patients, leading to increasing interest in new pharmacological substances, such as vanilloids. Our study addressed the question of whether vanilloids influence pancreatic cancer cell growth, and if vanilloids could be used for pain treatment via the vanilloid 1 receptor (VR1) in pancreatic cancer patients. METHODS: In vitro, the effect of resiniferatoxin (vanilloid analogue) on apoptosis and cell growth in pancreatic cancer cells--either alone, combined with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), or combined with gemcitabine--was determined by annexin V staining, FACS analysis, and MTT assay, respectively. VR1 expression was evaluated on RNA and protein level by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry in human pancreatic cancer and chronic pancreatitis. Patient characteristics--especially pain levels--were registered in a prospective database and correlated with VR1 expression. RESULTS: Resiniferatoxin induced apoptosis by targeting mitochondrial respiration and decreased cell growth in pancreatic cancer cells without showing synergistic effects with 5-FU or gemcitabine. Expression of VR1 was significantly upregulated in human pancreatic cancer and chronic pancreatitis. VR1 expression was related to the intensity of pain reported by cancer patients but not to the intensity of pain reported by patients with chronic pancreatitis. CONCLUSIONS: Resiniferatoxin induced apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells indicates that vanilloids may be useful in the treatment of human pancreatic cancer. Furthermore, vanilloid might be a novel and effective treatment option for neurogenic pain in patients with pancreatic cancer.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'AIM: To explore the etiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of postsurgical gastroparesis syndrome (PGS) after pancreatic cancer cryotherapy (PCC) or pancreatico-duodenectomy (PD), and to analyze the correlation between the multiple factors and PGS caused by the operations. METHODS: Clinical data of 210 patients undergoing PD and 46 undergoing PCC were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: There were 31 (67%, 31/46) patients suffering PGS in PCC group, including 29 with pancreatic head and uncinate tumors and 2 with pancreatic body and tail tumors. Ten patients (4.8%, 10/210) developed PGS in PD group, which had a significantly lower incidence of PGS than PCC group (chi= 145, P<0.001). In PCC group, 9 patients with PGS were managed with non-operative treatment (drugs, diet, nasogastric suction, etc.), and one received reoperation at the 16th day, but the symptoms were not relieved. In PD group, all the patients with PGS were managed with non-operative treatment. The PGS in patients undergoing PCC had close association with PCC, tumor location, but not with age, gender, obstructive jaundice, hypoproteinemia, preoperative gastric outlet obstruction and the type and number of gastric biliary tract operations. The mechanisms of PGS caused by PD were similar to those of PGS following gastrectomy. The damage to interstitial cells of Cajal might play a role in the pathogenesis of PGS after PCC, for which multiple factors were possibly responsible, including ischemic and neural injury to the antropyloric muscle and the duodenum after freezing of the pancreatico-duodenal regions or reduced circulating levels of motilin. CONCLUSION: PGS after PCC or PD is induced by multiple factors and the exact mechanisms, which might differ between these two operations, remain unknown. Radiography of the upper gastrointestinal tract and gastroscopy are main diagnostic modalities for PGS. Non-operative treatments are effective for PGS, and reoperation should be avoided in patients with PGS caused by PCC.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'The aim of the study was to assess the total energy expenditure (TEE), resting energy expenditure (REE) and physical activity level (PAL) in home-living cachectic patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. The influence of an energy and protein dense oral supplement either enriched with or without the n-3 fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and administered over an 8-week period was also determined. In total, 24 patients were studied at baseline. The total energy expenditure was measured using doubly labelled water and REE determined by indirect calorimetry. Patients were studied at baseline and then randomised to either oral nutritional supplement. Measurements were repeated at 8 weeks. At baseline, REE was increased compared with predicted values for healthy individuals (1387(42) vs 1268(32) kcal day(-1), P=0.001), but TEE (1732(82) vs 1903(48) kcal day(-1), P=0.023) and PAL (1.24(0.04) vs 1.50) were reduced. After 8 weeks, the REE, TEE and PAL of patients who received the control supplement did not change significantly. In contrast, although REE did not change, TEE and PAL increased significantly in those who received the n-3 (EPA) enriched supplement. In summary, patients with advanced pancreatic cancer were hypermetabolic. However, TEE was reduced and this was secondary to a reduction in physical activity. The control energy and protein dense oral supplement did not influence the physical activity component of TEE. In contrast, administration of the supplement enriched with EPA was associated with an increase in physical activity, which may reflect improved quality of life.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of gemcitabine (GEM) combined with capecitabine (CAP) in untreated patients with inoperable or metastatic pancreatic cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-three patients with pancreatic cancer (85% stage IV) were enrolled. Patients were treated with GEM 1000 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8 and CAP 1300 mg/m2 per day PO (per os), divided into two equal doses on days 1-14, in 21-day cycles. RESULTS: In an-intention-to-treat analysis, 10 (18.9%) objective partial responses were achieved (95% confidence interval 8.33% to 29.4%). Twenty-two (42%) patients had stable disease and 15 (28%) had progressive disease. The median response time was 3 months (range 1.5-7.0) and the median time to tumor progression was 6.5 months (range 3.5-15.5). Median overall survival time was 8 months (range 1.0-15.5) and 1-year survival was 34.8%. Pain improvement during treatment was observed in 23 of 43 (53%) patients, and eight of 18 (44%) patients who had been receiving opioids discontinued their use. Weight gain was observed in 12 of 33 (36%) patients. Grade 3 anemia occurred in five (9%) patients and grade 3-4 thrombocytopenia occurred in three (6%). Grade 3-4 neutropenia occurred in 13 (25%) and five (9%) patients, respectively, and two (4%) developed febrile neutropenia. Non-hematological toxicity was mild. CONCLUSION: In patients with pancreatic cancer, the combination of GEM with CAP is an active and well tolerated regimen that merits further evaluation in prospective randomized studies.',\n",

The overall 5-year survival rate is 4%, making this disease a model tumor in which to address the specialized care issues of palliative medicine. METHODS: General considerations in both medical decision-making and symptom management are reviewed. Treatment of patients with locally unresectable, recurrent, or metastatic disease is individualized, based on considerations that include patient age, patient wishes, family influence, insurance constraints, and geographic practice variations. RESULTS: Success in managing progressive symptoms is needed to palliate patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. Common problems include biliary obstruction, depression, pain, intestinal obstruction, and fatigue. CONCLUSIONS: Relief of pain and suffering associated with critical illness is required in managing patients with cancer. Pancreatic cancer is a model illness that mandates this need.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the existence of a newly recognized midline posterior column pathway that mediates the perception of visceral pain resulting from hepatobiliary or pancreatic cancer. A punctate midline myelotomy (PMM) of T(3) level was performed in 6 patients who experienced severe visceral pain caused by hepatobiliary or pancreatic cancer. Preoperatively, the pain was refractory to strong opioids. Clinical efficacy of PMM was evaluated by comparing patient pain rating on a visual analogue scale. Follow-up periods ranged from 2-18 weeks after operation. All 6 patients had immediate pain relief after operation. Although the pain recurred from 2-12 weeks later in 3 patients, the severity of recurrent cancer pain markedly decreased. No adverse neurological sequelae were observed. Our results of high thoracic PMM offer clinical support for the concept that neurosurgical interruption of midline visceral pain pathway can effectively control severe visceral pain without causing adverse neurological sequelae in patients with hepatobiliary or pancreatic cancer.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Neurolytic celiac plexus block (NCPB) is claimed to be an effective method of pain control for pancreatic cancer pain. However, the factors that may influence long-term analgesia, adverse effects, and quality of life after performing NCPB have never been determined. In a prospective multicenter study, 22 patients who underwent NCPB were followed until death. Numerous parameters other than pain and symptom intensity were evaluated, including age, gender, initial site of cancer, sites of pain, possible peritoneal involvement, technique, and oncologic interventions. Indices were calculated to determine the opioid consumption ratio (EAS) and the trend of opioid escalation (OEI). NCPB was effective in reducing opioid consumption and gastrointestinal adverse effects for at least 4 weeks. In the last four weeks prior to death, there was the typical trend of increasing symptom intensity common to the terminal cancer population. None of the factors studied influenced the analgesic effectiveness of NPCB. NPCB, performed by skilled clinicians, regardless of the technique chosen, is a safe and useful means that should be considered as an adjuvant to common analgesic regimens at any stage, as it may allow the reduction of the visceral component of pancreatic pain that may prevail in certain phases of the illness. The analgesic and symptomatic effect of NCPB is presumably advantageous for about four weeks. A possible factor interfering with long-term outcome includes the capacity of cancer to involve the celiac axis, which can distort the anatomy and prevent neurolytic spread, or modify the pain mechanisms. Outcomes are strongly based on individual variation.',\n",

       "  'AB': \"Smoking and diabetes are the only established risk factors for pancreatic cancer. Findings from recent studies suggest that obesity may also be associated with an increased risk of pancreatic cancer, but several earlier studies were less conclusive. We examined this relationship in a meta-analysis of published data. Six case-control and eight cohort studies involving 6391 cases of pancreatic cancer were identified from a computer-based literature search from 1966 to 2003. The relative risk per unit increase in body mass index was estimated for each of the studies from the published data. In a random effects model, the summary relative risk per unit increase in body mass index was 1.02 (95% CI: 1.01-1.03). There was some evidence of heterogeneity between the studies' results (P=0.1). The summary relative risk estimates were slightly higher for studies that had adjusted for smoking and for case-control studies that had not used proxy respondents. The estimated per unit increase in body mass index would translate into a relative risk of 1.19 (95% CI: 1.10-1.29) for obese people (30 kg m(-2)) compared to people with a normal body weight (22 kg m(-2)). These results provide evidence that the risk of pancreatic cancer may be weakly associated with obesity. However, the small magnitude of the summary risk means the possibility of confounding cannot be excluded.\",\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Gemcitabine has evolved as standard therapy in advanced pancreatic cancer since the demonstration of a significant clinical benefit. Phase II trials have shown that gemcitabine can be successfully combined with thymidylate synthase (TS) inhibitors such as continuous-infusion 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). However, continuous-infusion 5-FU is inconvenient because of the need for a central venous access. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of gemcitabine in combination with raltitrexed (Tomudex), a novel and selective TS inhibitor that has the advantage of a 3-weekly treatment interval and manageable toxicity. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Chemotherapy-naive patients with measurable advanced pancreatic cancer were treated with raltitrexed 3 mg/m(2) as a 15-min infusion on day 1 and gemcitabine 1000 mg/m(2) on days 1 and 8, every 21 days. RESULTS: Twenty-five eligible patients (17 male, eight female) with metastatic (21 patients) or locally advanced (four patients) disease entered the study. The median number of courses per patient was four (range 1-14). One patient was not evaluable for response. There were three partial remissions [12%; 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.6% to 31.2%] and nine stable disease situations (36%; 95% CI 18.0% to 57.5%), while the tumours of 12 patients (48%; 95% CI 27.8% to 68.7%) showed progressive disease after three treatment cycles. WHO grade 3/4 toxicity was rare and symptomatic in only one patient, who experienced grade 4 diarrhoea and grade 3 nausea and vomiting. Symptomatic benefit was seen in 12 patients. Median survival was 185 days (95% CI 129-241) with six patients still alive. CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy of raltitrexed plus gemcitabine is limited, but compares well with other chemotherapy treatment options in advanced pancreatic cancer. However, this combination is convenient and symptomatic toxicity is rare. Thus, raltitrexed and gemcitabine should be investigated further in combination with drugs interfering with specific molecular targets.',\n",

       "  'AB': \"As with other solid tumors, the growth and metastasis of pancreatic cancer is critically dependent on tumor angiogenesis. A major stimulus for a tumor's recruitment of additional blood vessels is cellular hypoxia, a condition which is especially pronounced in this neoplasm. Hypoxia induces transcriptional activation of genes that alter cellular metabolism and promote neoangiogenesis. Pancreatic cancer cells have demonstrated activation of such adaptive pathways even in the absence of hypoxia. A highly-angiogenic response in this neoplasm correlates with increased tumor growth, increased metastasis, and decreased survival. Pancreatic cancers expressing high levels of vascular endothelial growth factor, a potent pro-angiogenic cytokine, also have a higher incidence of metastasis and poorer prognosis. Pancreatic cancer cells uniquely express receptors for vascular endothelial growth factor, indicating a role for an autocrine loop in tumor proliferation and invasion. Multiple experimental anti-angiogenic strategies, many of which target vascular endothelial growth factor, reduce pancreatic cancer growth, spread, and angiogenesis. Anti-angiogenic treatments for pancreatic cancer will likely be most effective when used as an integral part of a combination chemotherapeutic regimen.\",\n",

Approximately 33,000 new cases of pancreatic cancer are predicted for the U.S. in 2002. Because diagnosis and intervention occur late in the course of this disease, the vast majority of patients already have metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis. These tumors are relatively resistant to systemic chemotherapy, making pancreatic cancer the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death in the U.S. and the Western world. For these reasons, efforts at identifying and treating disease-related symptomatology are priorities. This update overviews symptom management, supportive care strategies, and both standard and emerging palliative chemotherapy options. The incorporation of molecularly targeted therapies into treatment of metastatic pancreatic cancer is reviewed as well. These strategies are of relevance to internists, gastroenterologists, oncologists, and other specialists who care for patients with pancreatic cancer.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: The efficacy and toxicity of gemcitabine (GEM) and irinotecan (CPT-11) is evaluated in previously untreated patients with inoperable or metastatic pancreatic cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From January 1999 to July 2001, 60 patients with pancreatic cancer (85% stage IV) were enrolled in a two-step extended phase II trial. Patients were treated with gemcitabine (1,000 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8) and CPT-11 (300 mg/m2 on day 8) in cycles of 3 weeks. No prophylactic use of recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhG-CSF) was initially planned. RESULTS: In an intention-to-treat analysis one (1.7%) complete and 14 (23.3%) partial responses were achieved [objective response rate (ORR) 24.7%; 95% confidence interval 14.04% to 35.96%]. Twenty-two (36.7%) and 23 (38.3%) patients had stable and progressive disease, respectively. The median duration of response was 5 months, the median time to tumor progression (TTP) was 7 months and the median overall survival 7 months. One-year survival was 22.5%. Pain improvement and asthenia during treatment were observed in 45% and 43% of patients, respectively; weight gain occurred in 19.5% of patients. Grade 3 anemia occurred in three (5%) patients who required transfusion of six packed red blood cell (RBC) units. Ten (16.7%) additional patients with grade 2 anemia were treated with recombinant erythropoietin. Grade 3 thrombocytopenia occurred in seven (11.7%) patients and grades 3 and 4 neutropenia in 27 (45%). Ten patients developed febrile neutropenia, two of whom died due to sepsis. Prophylactic use of rhG-CSF was eventually required in 93 (28.3%) of 329 administered cycles. Other toxicities were mild. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of gemcitabine and irinotecan is an active chemotherapy regimen against pancreatic cancer with a 25% ORR. Toxicity was acceptable for the great majority of patients but with a high percentage of hematopoietic growth factor administration.',\n",

       "  'PG': '1576-82',\n",
       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Eniluracil is a potent, irreversible inactivator of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase, the major catabolic enzyme for 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Pretreatment with eniluracil significantly increases plasma half-life, plasma concentration and oral bioavailability of 5-FU. This multicenter phase II trial was designed to estimate the 6-month survival rate in patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas treated with 5-FU and eniluracil. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred and sixteen patients (61 with no prior chemotherapy and 55 with prior chemotherapy) were registered for treatment with eniluracil 50 mg (total dose) p.o. on days 1-7 and 5-FU 20 mg/m(2)/day p.o. on days 2-6 of a 28-day treatment cycle. RESULTS: In 106 patients evaluable for survival, the 6-month survival rate was 34% [95% confidence interval (CI) 22% to 47%, median survival 3.6 months] for patients who had not been treated previously with chemotherapy and 29% (95% CI 16% to 42%, median survival 3.4 months) for those who had received prior chemotherapy. For those patients with measurable disease, the confirmed response rates were 8% and 2%, respectively. The most common grade 3-4 toxicities were neutropenia (29% of patients) and diarrhea (12% of patients). Overall, 69% of patients experienced a grade 3 or worse adverse event during treatment. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the combination of a 7-day course of eniluracil and a 5-day course of oral 5-FU has limited activity in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer, and is associated with a high frequency of clinically significant adverse events.',\n",

Fifteen patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer that was histologically confirmed as adenocarcinoma were enrolled in this phase I trial of weekly gemcitabine (150-350 mg x m(-2)) with concurrent radiotherapy (50.4 Gy in 28 fractions). Gemcitabine was administered weekly as an intravenous 30-min infusion before radiotherapy for 6 weeks. Three of six patients at the dose of 350 mg x m(-2) of gemicitabine demonstrated dose-limiting toxicities involving neutropenia/ leukocytopenia and elevated transaminase, while nine patients at doses of 150 mg x m(-2) and 250 mg x m(-2) did not demonstrate any sign of dose-limiting toxicity. Of all 15 enrolled patients, six patients (40.0%) showed a partial response. More than 50% reduction of serum carbohydrate antigen 19-9 level was observed in 13 (92.9%) of 14 patients who had pretreatment carbohydrate antigen 19-9 levels of 100 U x ml(-1) or greater. The maximum-tolerated dose of weekly gemcitabine with concurrent radiotherapy was 250 mg x m(-2), and this regimen may have substantial antitumour activity for patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer. A phase II trial of weekly gemcitabine at the dose of 250 mg x m(-2) with concurrent radiation in patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer is now underway.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'The incidence of distant metastases is higher in the tumours with low oxygen pressure than in those with high oxygen pressure. It is well known that hypoxia induces the transcription of various genes involved in angiogenesis and anaerobic metabolism necessary for the growth of tumour cells in vivo, suggesting that hypoxia may also induce the transcription of metastasis-associated genes. We sought to identify the metastasis-associated genes differentially expressed in tumour cells under hypoxic conditions with the use of a DNA microarray system. We found that hypoxia enhanced the expression of autocrine motility factor mRNA in various cancer cells and also enhanced the random motility of pancreatic cancer cells. Autocrine motility factor inhibitors abrogated the increase of motility under hypoxic conditions. In order to explore the roles of hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha, we established hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha-transfectants and dominant negative hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha-transfectants. Transfection with hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha and dominant-negative hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha enhanced and suppressed the expression of autocrine motility factor/phosphohexase isomerase/neuroleukin mRNA and the random motility, respectively. These results suggest that hypoxia may promote the metastatic potential of cancer cells through the enhanced autocrine motility factor/phosphohexase isomerase/neuroleukin mRNA expression and that the disruption of the hypoxia-inducible factor-1 pathway may be an effective treatment for metastasis.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU)-based regimens have not been shown to prolong survival or provide clinical benefit in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. The purpose of this study was to determine the tolerability of protracted venous infusion (PVI) of 5-FU, modulated by a low dose of the synthetic antifolate trimetrexate, in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-three chemotherapy-naive patients were evaluated. Patients were enrolled in four consecutive cohorts in which the weekly dose of trimetrexate was escalated in 10 mg/m2 increments, from 20 to 50 mg/m2. PVI 5-FU was administered at a fixed dose of 225 mg/m2/day. Treatment was administered for 6 successive weeks, every 8 weeks. RESULTS: Twenty-two patients were assessable. The maximum tolerated dose of trimetrexate was 40 mg/m2. The most common grade 3 and 4 toxicity was diarrhea. There were no treatment-related deaths. Preliminary analysis of activity revealed a response rate of 9%, with 41% of the patients having stable disease for a median duration of 3.8 months. The median survival for the entire group was 6.9 months (range 1-29 months). A clinical benefit response was experienced by 27.2% of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Low-dose trimetrexate can be safely administered in combination with PVI 5-FU. This treatment is well tolerated and is associated with palliative activity in advanced pancreatic cancer.',\n",

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Pancreatic ACA patients, with previously untreated advanced or metastatic disease, were enrolled in a dose escalation study of gemcitabine and oxaliplatin. Oxaliplatin was given intravenously on day 1 and gemcitabine intravenously on days 1 and 8 of a 3-week cycle. Doses of both drugs were increased with sequential cohorts of patients until dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was observed. RESULTS: A total of 18 patients were enrolled to three dose levels. DLT of neutropenia and a severe infection was noted at a dose of gemcitabine 1250 mg/m2 and oxaliplatin 130 mg/m2. Hematological toxicity and nausea and vomiting were the most common grade 3/4 toxicities. The MTD, gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 and oxaliplatin 100 mg/m2, was well tolerated.

This evaluation often reveals the presence of a pancreatic mass or fullness. At times, the nature of the lesion is poorly characterized, with uncertainty remaining as to whether the lesion is an inflammatory mass or a neoplasm, and if it is cystic or solid. In these circumstances, endoscopic procedures such as endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and/or endoscopic ultrasound may be required. These procedures offer other means of tissue sampling, disease staging, and an option for palliative therapy.

       "  'AB': 'Pancreatic cancer has a poor response to conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Inhibition of matrix metalloproteinase activity involved in tumour invasion and metastases is a novel biological approach for cancer treatment. This multicentre phase II clinical trial assessed marimastat, an oral matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor, in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. A total of 113 patients received marimastat for 28 days at 100 mg b.d. (n = 9), 25 mg o.d. (n = 90) or 10 mg b.d. (n = 14). Patients with a response to treatment could continue marimastat beyond 28 days. Of 113 patients, 90 (80%) completed the 28-day study and 83 (73%) continued treatment. The principal side effect was arthralgia in 14 (12%) patients at 28 days and 33 (29%) patients over the whole study. There were 31 patients (27%) who required dose modification. Of 76 patients with evaluable CA19-9 levels, 23 (30%) showed no increase or fall in CA19-9. Of 83 patients with radiologically assessable disease, 41 (49%) had stable disease. The median survival was 245 days for those with a stable or falling CA19-9 level 128 days in those with rising CA19-9. The overall survival was 3.8 months. 5.9 months for stage II, 4.7 months for stage III and 3 months for stage IV disease. Of 90 patients, 46 (51%) had stabilization or reduction in pain, mobility and analgesia scores. Further development and clinical evaluation of matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors for the treatment of pancreatic cancer is warranted.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'The purpose of this study was to evaluate the technical possibilities of placing a catheter near the celiac plexus for performance of a celiac plexus block, and to study the efficacy of repeated neurolytic celiac plexus blocks with alcohol in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer pain resistant to opioid treatment. In 12 patients, a neurolytic celiac plexus block with alcohol, administered via an indwelling celiac catheter, was performed. To evaluate the efficacy, visual analog scale scores were recorded every day. Quality of life scores were registered before and 4 weeks following the procedure. Alterations in opioid consumption, and the time between the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer and the performance of the block, were registered. All patients were followed until they died. Two patients remained without pain after the first neurolytic celiac plexus block. In all other patients a second block was administered which provided only temporary relief. Additional intermittent administration of bupivacaine through the catheter was necessary to provide adequate pain relief in these patients. Quality of life increased significantly during the treatment. Opioid consumption decreased significantly in all patients. Our study indicates that a neurolytic celiac plexus blockade with alcohol results in a significant but short-lasting analgesic effect. The use of a celiac catheter improves the long-term management of pancreatic cancer pain.',\n",

Compared to younger patients, older patients are more likely to present with early-stage disease and, therefore, may be candidates for aggressive local treatment. Little published information exists on treatment outcomes for elderly patients with potentially resectable disease or those with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer. The limited information available suggests that elderly patients are as likely to benefit from surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy as younger patients. Despite this apparent benefit, elderly patients appear to have a worse long-term outcome. This may be due to the failure to offer them aggressive treatment or to comorbid conditions. Nevertheless, further studies need to be conducted in this area, and greater emphasis needs to be placed on including elderly patients in clinical trials. For elderly patients with terminal disease, there should be better use of palliative measures that may be of benefit. Each of these issues is discussed in detail.',\n",

RESULTS: The overall response rates by CT-scan evaluation were: 15% partial response (PR), 44% stable disease (SD), 17% progressive disease (PD). The overall median survival was 9.9 months, and 10.6 and 6.8 for UICC stage III and IV, respectively. Pain reduction occurred in 42% of patients. A weight gain > 7% from baseline occurred in 8% of patients. A total of 341 courses of FLEC were administered. Grade 3-4 hematological toxicity was seen in 25% of patients; ematemesis in 4%; grade 3 gastrointestinal toxicity in 3%; and grade 3 alopecia in 16%. One sudden death, a pre-infarction angina, and a transitory ischemic attack were observed. The only complication related to the angiographic procedure was an intimal dissection of the iliac artery. CONCLUSIONS: The intra-arterial FLEC regimen was well tolerated and active. It requires only one day of hospitalization. Efficacy could only be assessed in a randomized study against a gemcitabine containing regimen.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Previous studies have suggested that administration of oral eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) will stabilize weight in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. The aim of the present study was to determine if a combination of EPA with a conventional oral nutritional supplement could produce weight gain in these patients. Twenty patients with unresectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma were asked to consume two cans of a fish oil-enriched nutritional supplement per day in addition to their normal food intake. Each can contained 310 kcal, 16.1 g protein and 1.09 g EPA. Patients were assessed for weight, body composition, dietary intake, resting energy expenditure (REE) and performance status. Patients consumed a median of 1.9 cans day(-1). All patients were losing weight at baseline at a median rate of 2.9 kg month(-1). After administration of the fish oil-enriched supplement, patients had significant weight-gain at both 3 (median 1 kg, P= 0.024) and 7 weeks (median 2 kg, P = 0.033). Dietary intake increased significantly by almost 400 kcal day(-1) (P = 0.002). REE per kg body weight and per kg lean body mass fell significantly. Performance status and appetite were significantly improved at 3 weeks. In contrast to previous studies of oral conventional nutritional supplements in weight-losing cancer patients, this study suggests that an EPA-enriched supplement may reverse cachexia in advanced pancreatic cancer.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Weight loss is common in patients with pancreatic cancer; however, the nature and progress of their nutritional depletion are not well documented. In this study, pre-illness weight and duration of weight loss were recorded in 20 patients with histologically confirmed unresectable cancer of the pancreas. Patients then underwent nutritional analysis at monthly intervals until death. The median period of assessment was 27 weeks (interquartile range 22.5-38.0 weeks). At the time of diagnosis, all patients had lost weight [median 14.2% (10.0-20.0%) of pre-illness stable weight], and this weight loss was progressive, increasing to a median of 24.5% by the time of the last assessment (P =0.0004). Body mass index was significantly reduced from a pre-illness median value of 24.9 kg m-2 (22.4-27.4 kg m-2) to 20.7 kg m-2 (19.5-23.6 kg m-2) at the time of diagnosis and further to 17.7 kg m-2 (16.6-23.1 kg m-2) just before death (P =0.0003). Further evidence of tissue depletion was evident from the significant reductions in lean body mass [43.4 kg (36.9-53.0 kg) to 40.1 kg (33.5-50.7 kg) P =0.008] and fat mass [12.5 kg (8.9-17.8 kg) to 9.6 kg (6.3-15.1 kg) P =0.03). This study confirms that the majority of patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer have already undergone significant weight loss by the time of diagnosis and that the natural history of this process is one of inexorable progression. These results highlight the need for selective non-toxic therapeutic intervention to attenuate cachexia and indicate that such interventions should be instituted early in the course of the disease.',\n",

Clinical benefit response (CBR), a new way to assess clinical efficacy based on marked, sustained improvement in pain intensity, analgesic consumption, and performance status, was used to evaluate a new chemotherapeutic agent, gemcitabine (2',2'-difluorodeoxycytidine [Gemzar]). A phase III study of newly diagnosed pancreatic cancer patients treated with either gemcitabine or fluorouracil (5-FU) and a phase II trial of gemcitabine in patients whose disease had progressed despite prior treatment with 5-FU both demonstrated that a significant number of patients achieved a CBR with gemcitabine. Prolonged survival was a secondary benefit demonstrated in the phase III trial. In both studies, gemcitabine was well tolerated, with a relatively mild toxicity profile. These results suggest that gemcitabine may serve as a prototype for the development of more effective therapies for pancreatic cancer patients.\",\n",

       "  'AB': 'OBJECTIVE: To determine whether resting energy expenditure (REE) is increased in cachectic patients with pancreatic cancer and to define the relation of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) production to the acute-phase response and to REE. METHODS: Measurement of REE (indirect calorimetry) and assessment of body composition (bioelectrical impedance analysis) were done in 21 patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer and on 16 age-related controls. The systemic inflammatory response in peripheral blood of the cancer patients was assessed using the acute-phase protein, C-reactive protein, and the cytokines TNF and IL-6. Production of these cytokines by peripheral blood mononuclear cells in vitro was also measured. RESULTS: Patients with pancreatic cancer had an elevated REE when compared with controls (73.4 +/- 5.0 vs. 53.5 +/- 1.6 kcal/kg body cell mass; p < 0.003). Resting energy expenditure was significantly greater in cancer patients with an acute-phase response (C-reactive protein > 10 mg/L) than in those who did not have such a response (85.5 +/- 10.0 [n = 9] vs. 64.3 +/- 3.0 [n = 12] kcal/kg body cell mass; p < 0.04). Tumor necrosis factor was not detected in the serum of any of the cancer patients. Serum IL-6 was detected but levels were not significantly different among cancer patients with or without an acute-phase response. In contrast, spontaneous production of TNF and IL-6 by isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells was significantly greater in cancer patients with an acute-phase response that in those without (TNF: 1231 +/- 244 vs. 210 +/- 54 pg/ml/10(5) cells; p < 0.001; IL-6: 11.5 +/- 1.7 vs. 3.6 +/- 1.4 ng/mL/10(5) cells; p < 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: In pancreatic cancer at least a component of weight loss is due to increased REE. Furthermore, the presence of an acute-phase response identifies a group of patients who are markedly hypermetabolic. The serum concentration of TNF of IL-6 does not correlate with the presence of an acute-phase response, whereas rates of cytokine production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells are significantly greater in patients with such a response. This suggests that local rather than systemic cytokine production may be important in regulating the acute-phase response.',\n",

The purpose of this study was to determine if TGF alpha had a trophic effect on the growth of pancreatic cancer in vivo. Syrian golden hamsters were inoculated with 50,000 H2T hamster ductal pancreatic cancer cells. The hamsters were then randomised to three equal groups: the groups received either saline (control), EGF, or TGF alpha, each by intraperitoneal injection, three times a day. Treatment continued for seven weeks, and each week the hamsters were weighed and tumour areas were measured. The hamsters were then killed, and the tumours were excised, weighed, and extracted for assay of DNA content as a measure of cellularity. From week four onwards both EGF and TGF alpha significantly stimulated tumour growth. Although tumour weights were not significantly different, tumour DNA content had nearly doubled after exposure to both EGF and TGF alpha. It is concluded that like EGF, TGF alpha can stimulate pancreatic cancer growth in vivo, and this may in part explain the aggressive nature of these cancers in clinical practice.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'The serum values of the tumour markers carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), cancer-associated carboanhydrate antigens CA 50 and CA 242 were evaluated in 193 patients with hepatopancreato-biliary diseases by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis in order to compare their diagnostic accuracy in pancreatic cancer (n = 26), and to define optimal cut-off levels for the serum values of these tumour markers in the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. The ROC analysis showed that all marker tests are considerably sensitive (77-81%) at the specificity level of 80%. The CA 242 test was more sensitive than CEA and CA 50 at high specificity levels (> 0.90) but slightly less sensitive at low specificity levels (< 0.60). The CEA test and CA 50 test performed equally well at high and low specificity levels. According to this study, it would seem optimal to use the cut-off level of 4.1 ng ml-1 for CEA, and the level of 137 U ml-1 for CA 50, since they gave a sensitivity of 77% at the specificity levels of 83% and 84%, respectively. For CA 242 the optimal cut-off level was 21 U ml-1, which gave a sensitivity and specificity of 81%. In conclusion, the results of ROC curve analysis suggest that the CA 242 test has an advantage over CEA and CA 50 because of its higher specificity in pancreatic cancer. In addition, it would seem reasonable to use higher cut-off values than what has been recommended for CEA and CA 50 in the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer, but for CA 242 the recommended cut-off level of 20 U ml-1 seems appropriate.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Variations and refinements of the classic retrocrural technique of neurolytic celiac plexus block (NCPB) for pancreatic cancer pain (PCP) have been proposed over the last 30 yr to improve success rates, avoid complications and enhance diagnostic accuracy. The aim of this prospective, randomized study was to assess the efficacy and morbidity of three posterior percutaneous NCPB techniques in 61 patients with PCP. The 61 patients were randomly allocated to three NCPB treatment groups: group 1 (20 patients, transaortic plexus block); group 2 (20 patients, classic retrocrural block); and group 3 (21 patients, bilateral chemical splanchnicectomy). The quality and quantity of pain were analyzed before and after NCPB. No statistically significant differences (P greater than 0.05) were found among the three techniques in terms of either immediate or up-to-death results. Operative mortality was nil with the three techniques and morbidity negligible. NCPB abolished celiac PCP in 70-80% of patients immediately after the block and in 60-75% until death. Because celiac pain was only a component of PCP in all patients, especially in those with a longer time course until death: 1) abolition of such pain did not ensure high percentages of complete pain relief (immediate pain relief in 40-52%; pain relief until death in 10-24%); 2) NCPB was effective in controlling PCP in a higher percentage of cases if performed early after pain onset, when the pain was still only or mainly of celiac type and responded well to nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug therapy; and 3) the probability of patients remaining completely pain-free diminished with increased survival time.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)',\n",

Ninety-four cases of pancreatic cancer using the Whipple procedure at the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center between 1980 and 1986 were reviewed. The median survival time for patients reviewed was 4.5 months; 1- and 2-year survival rates were 16% and 6%, respectively. No survivals at 5 years were observed. Those who underwent resection (Group A) survived 12.9 months with 1- and 2-year survival rates of 54% and 27%. Those undergoing bypass procedures (Group B) had a median survival time of 6 months, with 1- and 2-year survival rates of 16% and 4%. No statistical difference in survival distribution was observed between Groups A and B. The median survival time of patients receiving a staging laparotomy with no therapeutic intervention (Group C) was 2.3 months. Group D patients either refused abdominal exploration or demonstrated signs of inoperability. Surgical mortality in Groups A and B was 8% and 10%, respectively. We suggest that clinical Stage 1 and carefully selected Stage 2 cases of pancreatic cancer should be treated by pancreatoduodenectomy. Stage 3 and 4 patients warrant simultaneous duodenal-biliary by-passes.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'The usefulness of serum DU-PAN-2 in diagnosing pancreatic cancer and in distinguishing between this cancer and other benign and malignant diseases, and to assess the role of liver dysfunction in altering the serum levels of this marker were investigated. DU-PAN-2 was measured in the sera of 31 patients with pancreatic cancer, 32 with chronic pancreatitis, 20 with benign and 21 with malignant extra-pancreatic diseases. DU-PAN-2 was found to be above 300 U ml-1 in 21/31 patients with pancreatic cancer (sensitivity 68%). Only 3/32 patients with chronic pancreatitis had abnormal values. A substantial number of patients with both benign and malignant extra-pancreatic diseases had an elevated serum DU-PAN-2 (9/20 and 15/21, respectively). Correlations were found between DU-PAN-2 and (1) total bilirubin, (2) alanine-amino-transferase and (3) alkaline phosphatase. Of the patients with high DU-PAN-2 values, jaundice was found in: 2/3 with chronic pancreatitis, 9/10 with benign and 12/14 with malignant extra-pancreatic diseases. In conclusion, the serum DU-PAN-2 test for pancreatic malignancy is not completely satisfactory, because it is not sensitive enough. While the test for chronic pancreatitis has an acceptable specificity, the assay cannot distinguish between pancreatic cancer and other extra-pancreatic diseases, mainly of the liver and biliary tract. Liver dysfunction as well as jaundice seem to considerable affect the levels of this marker, as reported elsewhere for CA 19-9.',\n",

       "  'AB': \"ERCP is a highly accurate and specific method for evaluating patients with suspected pancreatic disease. Its diagnostic significance of specific pancreatographic signs is of even greater importance. We reviewed 122 cases of pancreatic cancer who were done ERCP, at the Department of Internal Medicine, Yonsei University, College of Medicine between June 1973 and August 1983. The results were as follows: 1. The ages of 122 patients ranged from 27 to 76 with the majority in the 6th and the 7th decades. The male to female ratio was 2.49:1. 2. The success rate of cannulation into the orifice of the duodenal papilla in 122 cases was 97.5% (119/122), and the pancreatic duct was visualized in 91.0% (111/122). 3. Diagnostic accuracy of ERCP in pancreatic cancer was 96.4% (107/111) among cases in whom the pancreatic duct was visualized. 4. By ERCP the most common site of the lesion was head of pancreas (51.4%). 5. According to Fukumoto's classification, the most common type was obstructive type (65.4%), followed by the stenosing type (29.0%), abnormal branching type (3.7%), and narrowing type (1.9%). 6. According to Takaki's classification, Type I (obstruction or stenosis of the main pancreatic duct) was most common (85.6%), followed by Type III (pancreatic dilatation) (9.0%), Type IV (normal pancreatic duct) (3.6%), and Type II (obstruction of Wirsung's duct or Santorini's duct) (1.9%). 7. Of the 122 cases of pancreatic cancer, the bile duct was visualized in 55 and abnormalities, such as indentation (32.1%), stenosis (42.9%), and obstruction (25.0%) were found in 28. The locations of abnormal findings in the bile duct were distal (50.0%), middle (46.4%), and proximal (3.6%).\",\n",

The CA 19-9 concentration was above the cut-off limit (37 U ml-1) in 78% of the patients with pancreatic cancer and high levels (greater than 500 U ml-1) were seen in 56% of these patients. Elevated levels were also seen in benign diseases (22%), especially in patients with extrahepatic cholestasis (up to 440 U ml-1). Hepatocellular jaundice and pancreatitis were associated with normal values (84% of the patients), or with only slightly elevated CA 19-9 levels (up to 88 U ml-1). The CA 19-9 test can be useful as an additional diagnostic tool for the detection of pancreatic cancer. Preliminary results suggest that the CA 19-9 assay can be used in the monitoring of surgically treated patients.',\n",
