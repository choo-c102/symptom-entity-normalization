Radiomics has demonstrated its utility in recognizing patterns and anomalies not perceptible to the human eye. This systematic literature review aims to assess the application of radiomics in the analysis of pancreatic parenchyma images to identify early indicators predictive of PDAC. METHODS: A systematic search of original research papers was performed on three databases: PubMed, Embase, and Scopus. Two reviewers applied the inclusion and exclusion criteria, and one expert solved conflicts for selecting the articles. After extraction and analysis of the data, there was a quality assessment of these articles using the Methodological Radiomics Score (METRICS) tool. The METRICS assessment was carried out by two raters, and conflicts were solved by a third reviewer. RESULTS: Ten articles for analysis were retrieved. CT scan was the diagnostic imaging used in all the articles. All the studies were retrospective and published between 2019 and 2024. The main objective of the articles was to generate radiomics-based machine learning models able to differentiate pancreatic tumors from healthy tissue. The reported diagnostic performance of the model chosen yielded very high results, with a diagnostic accuracy between 86.5% and 99.2%. Texture and shape features were the most frequently implemented. The METRICS scoring assessment demonstrated that three articles obtained a moderate quality, five a good quality, and, finally, two articles yielded excellent quality. The lack of external validation and available model, code, and data were the major limitations according to the qualitative assessment. CONCLUSIONS: There is high heterogeneity in the research question regarding radiomics and pancreatic cancer. The principal limitations of the studies were mainly due to the nature of the trials and the considerable heterogeneity of the radiomic features reported. Nonetheless, the work in this field is promising, and further studies are still required to adopt radiomics in the early detection of PDAC.\",\n          \"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Pancreatic cancer (PC) carries a poor prognosis and is often detected at later stages. Screening programs for moderate- and high-risk people are still under debate. We present the results from a prospective study on endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) as a one-off screening tool for pancreatic cancer screening. METHODS: Asymptomatic patients with moderate- or high-risk of PC were invited to participate. Moderate risk consisted of one first-degree and at least one second-degree relative with PC and no PC-associated genetic mutations. High risk consisted of >1 first-degree relatives with PC or PC-associated mutations (i.e. BRCA2, Lynch Syndrome, Familial Atypical Multiple Mole Melanoma Syndrome, STK11, or PALB2). All included patients had genetic counseling and a screening EUS done. Primary outcome was the detection of PC on EUS. Secondary outcomes assessed the evolution of psychological symptoms based on the Impact of Events Scale (IES) and Personal Consequences Questionnaire (PCQ) before and after the screening took place. RESULTS: A total of 122 patients had a screening EUS performed between 2013 and 2019; 60 were male, 55.8 years was the mean age, 78 were at high risk for PC, and 25 had PC-associated mutations. No pancreatic cancers were identified at the one-off EUS screening. Overall, patients' IES/PCQ scores did not change after screening and feedback of no malignancy, with the exception of females (less concerned about PC after screening EUS). CONCLUSIONS: EUS did not detect any PCs in either a moderate- or high-risk population as a one-off screening method. The EUS procedure and genetic counseling improved psychological symptoms for the female subset of this population.\",\n          \"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the first point of contact in patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, and to study factors associated with the GP's suspicion of cancer, Cancer Patient Pathway (CPP) referral and long diagnostic interval. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study combining register and survey data. PATIENTS: Patients with incident pancreatic cancer recorded in the Danish National Patient Register (n = 303). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The patient's first point of symptoms presentation, GP's cancer suspicion, CPP referral and diagnostic interval. RESULTS: General practice was the first point of contact for 85.5% of the population. At the first consultation, cancer was suspected in 32.7% and 22.9% were referred to a CPP. The GPs were more likely to suspect cancer or serious illness in patients aged >70 years (prevalence rate ratio (PRR) 1.34, 95% CI 1.09-1.66) and among patients with high comorbidity (PRR 1.23, 95% CI 1.04-1.47). A CPP referral was less likely among patients with low education. The median diagnostic interval was 39 days (interquartile range: 15-72). When the GP initially did not suspect cancer, the likelihood of longer diagnostic interval increased. CONCLUSION: The majority of patients with pancreatic cancer began their diagnostic route in general practice. Diagnosing pancreatic cancer swiftly in general practice was challenging; the GP did often not initially suspect cancer or refer to a CPP and several of the patient characteristics were associated with the GPs initial suspicion of cancer or CPP referral. Thus, there may be room for improvements in the diagnostics of pancreatic cancer in general practice.Key pointsPatients with pancreatic cancer have a poor prognosis, as pancreatic cancer is often diagnosed in late stage.The majority of patients with pancreatic cancer began their diagnostic process in general practice.General practitioners (GPs) suspected cancer at the first consultation in one out of three patients with pancreatic cancer; more often in older and comorbid patients.The GPs suspicion of cancer was associated with urgent referral and shorter time to diagnosis.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"MeSH headings\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 125,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Aged; *Collateral Circulation; Computed Tomography Angiography; Female; Hepatic Artery/*surgery; Humans; Liver/blood supply; Male; Median Arcuate Ligament Syndrome/diagnosis/etiology/*surgery; Mesenteric Artery, Superior/*surgery; Pancreatic Neoplasms/complications/*surgery; Pancreaticoduodenectomy/*methods; Vascular Surgical Procedures/*methods\",\n          \"Aged; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Gastrointestinal Diseases/*etiology; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pancreatic Neoplasms/*radiotherapy; Prospective Studies; Radiation Injuries/*complications; Radiotherapy, Conformal/*adverse effects; Radiotherapy, Intensity-Modulated/*adverse effects; Risk Factors\",\n          \"Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use; Benzamides/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/drug therapy/genetics; Colorectal Neoplasms/drug therapy/genetics; Diphenylamine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics; ErbB Receptors/*antagonists & inhibitors; Female; Humans; Lung Neoplasms/drug therapy/genetics; Male; Middle Aged; Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors; *Mutation; Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics; Pancreatic Neoplasms/drug therapy/genetics; Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)/*genetics; Quinazolinones/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Authors\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 254,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Renjifo-Correa ME; Fanni SC; Bustamante-Cristancho LA; Cuibari ME; Aghakhanyan G; Faggioni L; Neri E; Cioni D\",\n          \"Efthymiou M; Chandran S; Zorron Cheng Tao Pu L; Collins A; Rajadurai A; Nikfarjam M; Vaughan R\",\n          \"Virgilsen LF; Rasmussen LA; Vedsted P; Jensen H\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Journal\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 139,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"The oncologist\",\n          \"Asian journal of neurosurgery\",\n          \"The American journal of case reports\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Year\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 3,\n        \"min\": 2006,\n        \"max\": 2025,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 17,\n        \"samples\": [\n          2024,\n          2019,\n          2020\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Month\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 18,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"May\",\n          \"Nov\",\n          \"Aug\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Source\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 254,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Cancers (Basel). 2025 Feb 26;17(5):803. doi: 10.3390/cancers17050803.\",\n          \"JGH Open. 2020 Oct 17;4(6):1217-1223. doi: 10.1002/jgh3.12432. eCollection 2020 Dec.\",\n          \"Scand J Prim Health Care. 2022 Mar;40(1):78-86. doi: 10.1080/02813432.2022.2036491.
