38785475,Impact of an Inter-Professional Clinic on Pancreatic Cancer Outcomes: A Retrospective Cohort Study.,"Background: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) presents significant challenges in diagnosis, staging, and appropriate treatment. Furthermore, patients with PDAC often experience complex symptomatology and psychosocial implications that require multi-disciplinary and inter-professional supportive care management from health professionals. Despite these hurdles, the implementation of inter-professional clinic approaches showed promise in enhancing clinical outcomes. To assess the effectiveness of such an approach, we examined the impact of the Wallace McCain Centre for Pancreatic Cancer (WMCPC), an inter-professional clinic for patients with PDAC at the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre (PM). Methods: This retrospective cohort study included all patients diagnosed with PDAC who were seen at the PM before (July 2012-June 2014) and after (July 2014-June 2016) the establishment of the WMCPC. Standard therapies such as surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy remained consistent across both time periods. The cohorts were compared in terms of survival rates, disease stage, referral patterns, time to treatment, symptoms, and the proportion of patients assessed and supported by nursing and allied health professionals. Results: A total of 993 patients were included in the review, comprising 482 patients pre-WMCPC and 511 patients post-WMCPC. In the multivariate analysis, adjusting for ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) and stage, it was found that post-WMCPC patients experienced longer median overall survival (mOS, HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.72-0.98, p = 0.023). Furthermore, the time from referral to initial consultation date decreased significantly from 13.4 to 8.8 days in the post-WMCPC cohort (p < 0.001), along with a reduction in the time from the first clinic appointment to biopsy (14 vs. 8 days, p = 0.022). Additionally, patient-reported well-being scores showed improvement in the post-WMCPC cohort (p = 0.02), and these patients were more frequently attended to by nursing and allied health professionals (p < 0.001). Conclusions: The implementation of an inter-professional clinic for patients diagnosed with PDAC led to improvements in overall survival, patient-reported well-being, time to initial assessment visit and pathological diagnosis, and symptom management. These findings advocate for the adoption of an inter-professional clinic model in the treatment of patients with PDAC.","Humans; Retrospective Studies; *Pancreatic Neoplasms/therapy; Female; Male; Aged; Middle Aged; Carcinoma, Pancreatic Ductal/therapy; Treatment Outcome; Cohort Studies; Aged, 80 and over",Moffat GT; Coyne Z; Albaba H; Aung KL; Dodd A; Espin-Garcia O; Moura S; Gallinger S; Kim J; Fraser A; Hutchinson S; Moulton CA; Wei A; McGilvray I; Dhani N; Jang R; Elimova E; Moore M; Prince R; Knox J,"Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2024,May,Curr Oncol. 2024 May 2;31(5):2589-2597. doi: 10.3390/curroncol31050194.,Switzerland,398,11119140
31677259,"Do Patients Diagnosed with Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer Benefit from Primary Tumor Surgery? A Propensity-Adjusted, Population-Based Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Analysis.","BACKGROUND With the progress in surgical techniques and management of complications, pancreatic resection can be safely performed in experienced hospitals. Pancreatic resection enables surgeons to assess the effect of surgery for metastatic cases, even when there is limited information. In the present study we evaluated the role of primary tumor resection for metastatic pancreatic cancer (mPC) by using the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database. MATERIAL AND METHODS Metastatic pancreatic cancer patients treated at our hospital from 2004 to 2015 were identified. The effect of surgery on cancer-specific survival was assessed by restricted mean survival time (RMST) and stabilized inverse probability of treatment weight-adjusted analysis after propensity score matching (PSM). RESULTS A total of 2694 mPC patients were included. Of this population, 365 adults underwent primary tumor resection. After propensity matching, postsurgical patients had longer RMST than non-surgery patients (1: 1 PSM 11.60 months vs. 8.98 months; 1: 2 PSM 11.61 months vs. 9.10 months; p<0.01). Stabilized inverse probability of treatment weight-adjusted analysis yielded similar results (p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS Our study supports the hypothesis that patients with mPC can benefit from primary tumor surgery. However, the surgical inclusion criteria and the appropriate role of surgery, such as its effect on symptom control, quality of life, and the extent to which it prolongs survival for metastatic pancreatic cancer, remain to be completely assessed by well-designed, prospective, randomized clinical trials.",Adult; Aged; China; Female; Humans; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Metastasis/therapy; Pancreatectomy; Pancreatic Neoplasms/*complications/*mortality/*surgery; Propensity Score; Prospective Studies; Quality of Life; SEER Program; Survival Rate,Wang L; Yang L; Chen L; Chen Z,Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,2019,Nov,Med Sci Monit. 2019 Nov 2;25:8230-8241. doi: 10.12659/MSM.917106.,United States,346,6852709
30894932,"A Review of Pancreatic Cancer: Epidemiology, Genetics, Screening, and Management.","Pancreatic cancer ranks among the causes of cancer-related deaths. The average size of pancreatic cancer during diagnosis is about 31 mm and has not changed significantly over the past 30 years. Poor early diagnosis of a tumour has been attributed to the late-presenting symptoms. Over the years, improvement in the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer has been observed, and this can be linked to advancement in imaging techniques as well as the increasing knowledge of cancer history and genetics. Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Endoscopic Ultrasound, and Computer Topography are the approved imaging modalities utilised in the diagnosing of pancreatic cancer. Over the years, the management of patients with pancreatic cancer has seen remarkable improvement as reliable techniques can now be harnessed and implemented in determining the resectability of cancer. However, only about 10% of pancreatic adenocarcinomas are resectable at the time of diagnosis and will highly benefit from a microscopic margin-negative surgical resection. Overall, the failure of early tumour identification will result in considerable morbidity and mortality.",,Idachaba S; Dada O; Abimbola O; Olayinka O; Uma A; Olunu E; Fakoya AOJ,Open access Macedonian journal of medical sciences,2019,Feb,Open Access Maced J Med Sci. 2019 Feb 14;7(4):663-671. doi: 10.3889/oamjms.2019.104. eCollection 2019 Feb 28.,North Macedonia,233,6420955
26328610,Integrative analysis of multi-omics data for identifying multi-markers for diagnosing pancreatic cancer.,"BACKGROUND: microRNA (miRNA) expression plays an influential role in cancer classification and malignancy, and miRNAs are feasible as alternative diagnostic markers for pancreatic cancer, a highly aggressive neoplasm with silent early symptoms, high metastatic potential, and resistance to conventional therapies. METHODS: In this study, we evaluated the benefits of multi-omics data analysis by integrating miRNA and mRNA expression data in pancreatic cancer. Using support vector machine (SVM) modelling and leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV), we evaluated the diagnostic performance of single- or multi-markers based on miRNA and mRNA expression profiles from 104 PDAC tissues and 17 benign pancreatic tissues. For selecting even more reliable and robust markers, we performed validation by independent datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) data depository. For validation, miRNA activity was estimated by miRNA-target gene interaction and mRNA expression datasets in pancreatic cancer. RESULTS: Using a comprehensive identification approach, we successfully identified 705 multi-markers having powerful diagnostic performance for PDAC. In addition, these marker candidates annotated with cancer pathways using gene ontology analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Our prediction models have strong potential for the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer.","Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics; *Computational Biology; Humans; MicroRNAs/*metabolism; Pancreatic Neoplasms/*diagnosis/*genetics/metabolism; RNA, Messenger/*metabolism; *Transcriptome",Kwon MS; Kim Y; Lee S; Namkung J; Yun T; Yi SG; Han S; Kang M; Kim SW; Jang JY; Park T,BMC genomics,2015,,BMC Genomics. 2015;16 Suppl 9(Suppl 9):S4. doi: 10.1186/1471-2164-16-S9-S4.

36358718,Immunomodulatory Effects of Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy and Vaccination with Heat-Killed Mycobacterium Obuense (IMM-101) in Patients with Locally Advanced Pancreatic Cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC) are treated with chemotherapy. In selected cases, stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) can be added to the regimen. We hypothesized that adding an adjuvant containing a heat-killed mycobacterium (IMM-101) to SBRT may lead to beneficial immuno-modulatory effects, thereby improving survival. This study aims to investigate the safety of adding IMM-101 to SBRT and to investigate the immuno-modulatory effects of the combination treatment in the peripheral blood of LAPC patients. METHODS: LAPC patients were treated with SBRT (40 Gy) and six intradermal vaccinations of one milligram IMM-101. The primary endpoint was an observed toxicity rate of grade 4 or higher. Targeted gene-expression profiling and multicolor flow cytometry were performed for longitudinal immune-monitoring of the peripheral blood. RESULTS: Twenty patients received study treatment. No treatment-related adverse events of grade 4 or higher occurred. SBRT/IMM-101 treatment induced a transient decrease in different lymphocyte subsets and an increase in CD14+CD16-CD11b+HLA-DR(low) myeloid-derived suppressor cells. Importantly, treatment significantly increased activated ICOS+, HLA-DR+ and Ki67+PD1+ T and NK cell frequencies. This was not accompanied by increased levels of most inhibitory markers, such as TIM-3 and LAG-3. CONCLUSIONS: Combination therapy with SBRT and a heat-killed mycobacterium vaccine was safe and had an immune-stimulatory effect.",,van 't Land FR; Lau SP; de Koning W; Klaase L; Vink M; van Krimpen A; Dumas J; Vadgama D; Nuyttens JJ; Mustafa DAM; Stadhouders R; Willemsen M; Stubbs AP; Aerts JG; van Eijck CHJ,Cancers,2022,Oct,Cancers (Basel). 2022 Oct 27;14(21):5299. doi: 10.3390/cancers14215299.,Switzerland,426,9656492
34586588,Multifunctional thiosemicarbazones targeting sigma receptors: in vitro and in vivo antitumor activities in pancreatic cancer models.,"PURPOSE: Association of the metal chelating portion of thiosemicarbazone with the cytotoxic activity of sigma-2 receptors appears a promising strategy for the treatment of pancreatic tumors. Here, we developed a novel sigma-2 receptor targeting thiosemicarbazone (FA4) that incorporates a moiety associated with lysosome destabilization and ROS increase in order to design more efficient antitumor agents. METHODS: The density of sigma receptors in pancreatic cancer cells was evaluated by flow cytometry. In these cells, cytotoxicity (MTT assay) and activation of ER- and mitochondria-dependent cell death pathways (mRNA expression of GRP78, ATF6, IRE1, PERK; ROS levels by MitoSOX and DCFDA-AM; JC-1 staining) induced by the thiosemicarbazones FA4, MLP44, PS3 and ACthio-1, were evaluated. The expression of autophagic proteins (ATG5, ATG7, ATG12, beclin, p62 and LC3-I) was also studied. In addition, the in vivo effect of FA4 in xenograft models with and without gemcitabine challenge was investigated. RESULTS: We found that FA4 exerted a more potent cytotoxicity than previously studied thiosemicarbazones (MLP44, PS3 and ACthio-1), which were found to display variable effects on the ER or the mitochondria-dependent pro-apoptotic axis. By contrast, FA4 activated pro-apoptotic pathways and decreased autophagy, except in MiaPaCa2 cells, in which autophagic proteins were expressed at lower levels and remained unmodified by FA4. FA4 treatment of PANC-1 xenografted mouse models, poorly responsive to conventional chemotherapy, significantly reduced tumor volumes and increased intratumor apoptosis compared to gemcitabine, with no signs of toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that FA4 exhibits encouraging activity in pancreatic cancer cells unresponsive to gemcitabine. These results warrant further investigation in patient-derived pancreatic cancers, and hold promise for the development of therapies that can more efficiently target the specific characteristics of individual tumor types.","Animals; Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/pharmacology/*therapeutic use; Apoptosis/drug effects; Autophagy/drug effects; Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/metabolism; Caspases/metabolism; Cell Death/drug effects; Cell Line, Tumor; Disease Models, Animal; Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress/drug effects; Enzyme Activation/drug effects; Female; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Nude; Mitochondria/drug effects/pathology; Pancreatic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics/*pathology; Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism; Receptors, sigma/*metabolism; Thiosemicarbazones/chemistry/pharmacology/*therapeutic use; Mice",Niso M; Kopecka J; Abatematteo FS; Berardi F; Riganti C; Abate C,"Cellular oncology (Dordrecht, Netherlands)",2021,Dec,Cell Oncol (Dordr). 2021 Dec;44(6):1307-1323. doi: 10.1007/s13402-021-00638-5.

33319059,Outcomes of endoscopic ultrasound as a one-off pancreatic cancer screening tool for 122 high- and moderate-risk patients.,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Pancreatic cancer (PC) carries a poor prognosis and is often detected at later stages. Screening programs for moderate- and high-risk people are still under debate. We present the results from a prospective study on endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) as a one-off screening tool for pancreatic cancer screening. METHODS: Asymptomatic patients with moderate- or high-risk of PC were invited to participate. Moderate risk consisted of one first-degree and at least one second-degree relative with PC and no PC-associated genetic mutations. High risk consisted of >1 first-degree relatives with PC or PC-associated mutations (i.e. BRCA2, Lynch Syndrome, Familial Atypical Multiple Mole Melanoma Syndrome, STK11, or PALB2). All included patients had genetic counseling and a screening EUS done. Primary outcome was the detection of PC on EUS. Secondary outcomes assessed the evolution of psychological symptoms based on the Impact of Events Scale (IES) and Personal Consequences Questionnaire (PCQ) before and after the screening took place. RESULTS: A total of 122 patients had a screening EUS performed between 2013 and 2019; 60 were male, 55.8 years was the mean age, 78 were at high risk for PC, and 25 had PC-associated mutations. No pancreatic cancers were identified at the one-off EUS screening. Overall, patients' IES/PCQ scores did not change after screening and feedback of no malignancy, with the exception of females (less concerned about PC after screening EUS). CONCLUSIONS: EUS did not detect any PCs in either a moderate- or high-risk population as a one-off screening method. The EUS procedure and genetic counseling improved psychological symptoms for the female subset of this population.",,Efthymiou M; Chandran S; Zorron Cheng Tao Pu L; Collins A; Rajadurai A; Nikfarjam M; Vaughan R,JGH open : an open access journal of gastroenterology and hepatology,2020,Dec,JGH Open. 2020 Oct 17;4(6):1217-1223. doi: 10.1002/jgh3.12432. eCollection 2020 Dec.,Australia,349,7731834
30397425,Current role of palliative interventions in advanced pancreatic cancer.,"Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is the third leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Unfortunately, at diagnosis, most patients are not candidates for curative resection. Surgical palliation, a procedure performed with the intention of relieving symptoms or improving quality of life, comes to the forefront of management. This article reviews the palliative management of unresectable pancreatic cancer, including obstructive jaundice, duodenal obstruction and pain control with celiac plexus block. Although surgical bypasses for both biliary and duodenal obstructions usually achieve good technical success, they result in considerable perioperative morbidity and mortality, even when performed laparoscopically. The effectiveness of self-expanding metal stents for biliary drainage is excellent with low morbidity. Surgical gastrojejunostomy for duodenal obstruction appears to be best for patients with a life expectancy of greater than 2 mo while endoscopic stenting has been shown to be feasible with good symptom relief in those with a shorter life expectancy. Regardless of the palliative procedure performed, all physicians involved must be adequately trained in end of life management to ensure the best possible care for patients.",,Ciambella CC; Beard RE; Miner TJ,World journal of gastrointestinal surgery,2018,Oct,World J Gastrointest Surg. 2018 Oct 27;10(7):75-83. doi: 10.4240/wjgs.v10.i7.75.,United States,395,6212542
34249755,Expression and Role of Heparan Sulfated Proteoglycans in Pancreatic Cancer.,"Pancreatic cancer is a lethal condition with poor outcomes and an increasing incidence. The unfavourable prognosis is due to the lack of early symptoms and consequent late diagnosis. An effective method for the early diagnosis of pancreatic cancer is therefore sought by many researchers in the field. Heparan sulfated proteoglycan-related genes are often expressed differently in tumors than in normal tissues. Alteration of the tumor microenvironment is correlated with the ability of heparan sulfated proteoglycans to bind cytokines and growth factors and eventually to influence tumor progression. Here we discuss the importance of glypicans, syndecans, perlecan and extracellular matrix modifying enzymes, such as heparanases and sulfatases, as potential diagnostics in pancreatic cancer. We also ran an analysis on a multidimensional cancer genomics database for heparan sulfated proteoglycan-related genes, and report altered expression of some of them.",,Furini S; Falciani C,Frontiers in oncology,2021,,Front Oncol. 2021 Jun 25;11:695858. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2021.695858. eCollection 2021.,Switzerland,441,8267412
39925518,Factors Affecting Patency of Uncovered Duodenal Stents in Malignant Duodenal Stenosis Due to Pancreatic Cancer: A Retrospective Cohort Study.,"Introduction Malignant duodenal stenosis is a common complication in patients with pancreatic cancer, significantly impairing quality of life by obstructing oral intake. Duodenal stenting has become a preferred palliative intervention, offering minimally invasive symptom relief and allowing for the continuation of systemic chemotherapy. However, factors influencing stent patency remain underexplored. This study aimed to identify clinical, procedural, and tumor-related factors that affect the patency of uncovered duodenal stents in malignant duodenal stenosis caused by pancreatic cancer. Methods A retrospective cohort study was conducted at Chiba University Hospital, Chiba, Japan, analyzing data from 53 patients who underwent placement of 22 mm uncovered duodenal stents between June 2016 and December 2023. Eligibility criteria included that the primary tumor had not been resected and that no intestinal reconstruction had been performed. Data on patient demographics, tumor characteristics, procedural details, and outcomes were collected. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to evaluate factors influencing stent patency using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards modeling. Results The mean patency duration for uncovered duodenal stents was 474 days, with stent occlusion occurring in 11 (20.8%) patients. Univariate analysis identified prior placement of transpapillary biliary plastic stents as significantly associated with reduced stent patency (p = 0.0057). Multivariate analysis confirmed this as an independent predictor of shorter patency (hazard ratio, 5.75; 95% CI, 1.37-24.22; p = 0.017). Tumor size, chemotherapy administration, and the location of duodenal stenosis were not significantly associated with stent patency. Conclusions Prior placement of transpapillary biliary plastic stents significantly reduces the patency of uncovered duodenal stents in patients with malignant duodenal stenosis caused by pancreatic cancer. This underscores the importance of procedural planning, including consideration of alternative biliary drainage methods, to optimize stent performance and improve patient outcomes.",,Takahashi K; Ohyama H; Ohno I; Kato N,Cureus,2025,Jan,Cureus. 2025 Jan 10;17(1):e77245. doi: 10.7759/cureus.77245. eCollection 2025 Jan.,United States,380,11807416
23152670,The relationship between patient satisfaction with service quality and survival in pancreatic cancer.,"PURPOSE: Despite the recognized relevance of symptom burden in pancreatic cancer, there has been limited exploration of whether an individual patient's satisfaction with the overall quality of care received might influence outcome. We evaluated the relationship between patient satisfaction with health service quality and survival in patients with pancreatic cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A random sample of 496 pancreatic cancer patients treated at Cancer Treatment Centers of America((R)) (CTCA) between July 2007 and December 2010. A questionnaire that covered several dimensions of patient satisfaction was administered. Items were measured on a seven-point Likert scale ranging from ""completely dissatisfied"" to ""completely satisfied."" Patient survival was the primary end point. Cox regression was used to evaluate the association between patient satisfaction and survival. RESULTS: The response rate for this study was 72%. Of the 496 patients, 345 (69.6%) reported being ""completely satisfied"" with the care provided. Median overall survival was 7.9 months. On univariate analysis, patients reporting they were ""completely satisfied"" experienced superior survival compared with patients stating they were ""not completely satisfied"" (hazard ratio = 0.62; 95% confidence interval: 0.50-0.77; P < 0.001). On multivariate analysis controlling for stage at diagnosis, treatment history, and specific CTCA treatment center, ""completely satisfied"" patients demonstrated significantly lower mortality (hazard ratio = 0.63; 95% confidence interval: 0.51-0.79; P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: In this exploratory analysis, patient satisfaction with health service quality was an independent predictor of survival in pancreatic cancer. Further exploration of a possible meaningful relationship between patient satisfaction with the care they have received and outcome in this difficult malignancy is indicated.",,Gupta D; Markman M; Rodeghier M; Lis CG,Patient preference and adherence,2012,,Patient Prefer Adherence. 2012;6:765-72. doi: 10.2147/PPA.S37900.

38001567,The Unmet Needs of Pancreatic Cancer Carers Are Associated with Anxiety and Depression in Patients and Carers.,"Pancreatic cancer has one of the lowest survival rates, and patients experience debilitating symptoms. Family carers provide essential daily care. This study determined the prevalence of and risk factors for unmet supportive care needs among carers for pancreatic cancer patients and examined which carer needs were associated with anxiety and depression in carers and patients. Eighty-four pancreatic cancer patients and their carers were recruited. The carers completed a needs survey (SCNS-P&C). Both carers and patients completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Log binomial regression was used to identify associations between carer needs and anxiety and depression among carers and patients. The top 10 moderate-to-high unmet needs reported by >/=28% of carers were related to healthcare (e.g., discussing concerns with doctors) and information need domains (e.g., information about a patient's physical needs), plus one other item related to hospital parking. Being male or caring for a patient within 4 months of their diagnosis were associated with greater unmet needs. Some unmet needs, including 'accessing information about treatments' and 'being involved in patient care', were associated with both carers and patients having anxiety and depression. Carers should be involved in health care consultations and provided with information and opportunities to discuss concerns.",,Huynh TNT; Hartel G; Janda M; Wyld D; Merrett N; Gooden H; Neale RE; Beesley VL,Cancers,2023,Nov,Cancers (Basel). 2023 Nov 7;15(22):5307. doi: 10.3390/cancers15225307.,Switzerland,498,10670364
31245208,A Case of Rapidly Deteriorating Lymphangitic Carcinomatosis in a Patient with Stage IV Pancreatic Cancer.,"Pulmonary lymphangitic carcinomatosis (PLC) is defined as a tumor in the lung lymphatic vessels. It is rarely seen as a result of malignancy and generally carries a poor prognosis. Proper knowledge of the clinical presentation is important for physicians to be aware of in order to consider a diagnosis of PLC. We present the case of a 52-year-old Caucasian gentleman who initially came to the hospital with a three-week history of dyspnea. In the hospital, a diagnosis of Stage 4 pancreatic cancer with a lymphangitic spread of the tumor to the lungs was made. Despite optimal treatment, the patient required mechanical ventilation for acute hypoxic respiratory failure. PLC is a relatively rare manifestation of malignancy; yet, it generally carries a poor prognosis. It may occur during the course of malignancy or may represent as the first findings in malignancy. It is important for physicians to be aware of the clinical presentations of PLC in order to ensure timely treatment.

36769322,Salivary Polyamines Help Detect High-Risk Patients with Pancreatic Cancer: A Prospective Validation Study.,"Pancreatic cancer is one of the most malignant cancer types and has a poor prognosis. It is often diagnosed at an advanced stage because of the absence of typical symptoms. Therefore, it is necessary to establish a screening method for the early detection of pancreatic cancer in high-risk individuals. This is a prospective validation study conducted in a cohort of 1033 Japanese individuals (male, n = 467, age = 63.3 +/- 11.5 years; female, n = 566, age = 64.2 +/- 10.6 years) to evaluate the use of salivary polyamines for screening pancreatic diseases and cancers. Patients with pancreatic cancer were not included; however, other pancreatic diseases were treated as positive cases for accuracy verification. Of the 135 individuals with elevated salivary polyamine markers, 66 had pancreatic diseases, such as chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic cysts, and 1 had gallbladder cancer. These results suggest that the salivary polyamine panel is a useful noninvasive pancreatic disease screening tool.",Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Aged; Polyamines; *Pancreatic Neoplasms/diagnosis; *Pancreatic Diseases; Pancreas,Nose D; Sugimoto M; Muta T; Miura SI,International journal of molecular sciences,2023,Feb,Int J Mol Sci. 2023 Feb 3;24(3):2998. doi: 10.3390/ijms24032998.,Switzerland,216,9918012
38067306,Timing of Initiation of Palliative Chemotherapy in Asymptomatic Patients with Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer: An International Expert Survey and Case-Vignette Study.,"Background: The use of imaging, in general, and during follow-up after resection of pancreatic cancer, is increasing. Consequently, the number of asymptomatic patients diagnosed with metastatic pancreatic cancer (mPDAC) is increasing. In these patients, palliative systemic therapy is the only tumor-directed treatment option; hence, it is often immediately initiated. However, delaying therapy in asymptomatic palliative patients may preserve quality of life and avoid therapy-related toxicity, but the impact on survival is unknown. This study aimed to gain insight into the current perspectives and clinical decision=making of experts regarding the timing of treatment initiation of patients with asymptomatic mPDAC. Methods: An online survey (13 questions, 9 case-vignettes) was sent to all first and last authors of published clinical trials on mPDAC over the past 10 years and medical oncologists of the Dutch Pancreatic Cancer Group. Inter-rater variability was determined using the Kappa Light test. Differences in the preferred timing of treatment initiation among countries, continents, and years of experience were analyzed using Fisher's exact test. Results: Overall, 78 of 291 (27%) medical oncologists from 15 countries responded (62% from Europe, 23% from North America, and 15% from Asia-Pacific). The majority of respondents (63%) preferred the immediate initiation of chemotherapy following diagnosis. In 3/9 case-vignettes, delayed treatment was favored in specific clinical contexts (i.e., patient with only one small lung metastasis, significant comorbidities, and higher age). A significant degree of inter-rater variability was present within 7/9 case-vignettes. The recommended timing of treatment initiation differed between continents for 2/9 case-vignettes (22%), in 7/9 (77.9%) comparing the Netherlands with other countries, and based on years of experience for 5/9 (56%). Conclusions: Although the response rate was limited, in asymptomatic patients with mPDAC, immediate treatment is most often preferred. Delaying treatment until symptoms occur is considered in patients with limited metastatic disease, more comorbidities, and higher age.",,Augustinus S; van Laarhoven HWM; Cirkel GA; de Groot JWB; Groot Koerkamp B; Macarulla T; Melisi D; O'Reilly EM; van Santvoort HC; Mackay TM; Besselink MG; Wilmink JW,Cancers,2023,Nov,Cancers (Basel). 2023 Nov 27;15(23):5603. doi: 10.3390/cancers15235603.,Switzerland,617,10705283
27812517,A Study on the Dietary Intake and the Nutritional Status among the Pancreatic Cancer Surgical Patients.,"The adequate dietary intake is important to maintain the nutritional status of the patients after pancreatic cancer surgery. This prospective study was designed to investigate the dietary intake and the nutritional status of the patients who had pancreatic cancer surgery. Thirty-one patients (15 men, 16 women) were enrolled and measured body weight, body mass index (BMI), nutritional risk index (NRI), and Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool (MUST). Actual oral intake with nutritional impact symptoms recorded on the clinical research foam at every meal and medical information were collected from electronic medical charts. The rates of malnutrition at admission were 45.1% (14/31) and 28.9% (9/31) by NRI and MUST method, respectively, but those were increased to 87% (27/31) and 86.6% (26/31) after operation on discharge. The median values of daily intake of energy, carbohydrates, fat, and protein were 588.1 kcal, 96.0 g, 11.8 g, and 27.0 g, respectively. Most patients (n = 20, 64.5%) experienced two or more symptoms such as anorexia, abdominal bloating and early satiety. There were negative correlations between C-reactive protein (CRP) levels and the intake of total energy, protein, fat, and zinc. The rates of malnutrition were increased sharply after surgery and the dietary intake also influenced the inflammatory indicators. The results suggested that need of considering special therapeutic diets for the patients who received pancreatic surgery.",,Kang J; Park JS; Yoon DS; Kim WJ; Chung HY; Lee SM; Chang N,Clinical nutrition research,2016,Oct,Clin Nutr Res. 2016 Oct;5(4):279-289. doi: 10.7762/cnr.2016.5.4.279.

39457673,Characteristics of Gut Microbiome in the Murine Model of Pancreatic Cancer with Damp-Heat Syndrome.,"PURPOSE: Murine models of pancreatic cancer with damp-heat syndrome were established based on two methods to explore the differences in the composition of intestinal flora and to seek characteristic genera with potential for model evaluation. METHODS: In our study, thirty-four C57BL/6J male mice were randomly divided into a control group (Con), a model group (Mod), a classic damp-heat syndrome group (CDHS), and a climate-chamber group (CC). CDHS and CC groups were fed with a high-fat diet and glucose water, while the CDHS group was given 2.4 g/kg alcohol by gavage for 10 days, and the CC group was placed in a climatic chamber with a set temperature of (32 +/- 1)  degrees C and humidity of (92 +/- 2)% for 10 days. The Mod group, CDHS group, and CC group underwent tumor-building experiments on day 11. Tumorigenicity was then assessed twice a week. After 4 weeks, feces, colon tissue, and tumor tissue were taken from the mice and were tested, and the mice were euthanized afterwards. RESULTS: Mice in the CDHS and CC groups showed symptoms similar to the clinical damp-heat syndrome observed in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), and exhibited a worse general condition and more rapid tumor growth trend than those in the Mod group. The pathological examination indicated that inflammation was prevalent in the CDHS and CC groups. Both groups had a disrupted intestinal barrier and an overgrowth of pathogenic bacteria such as c_Gammaproteobacteria, o_Enterobacteriales, and g_Bacteroides. Their microbiota composition showed greater diversity. CONCLUSIONS: Intestinal flora may have a promising future in the discovery of indicators for evaluating a model of damp-heat syndrome in pancreatic cancer.",,Tong Y; Han F; Liu M; Xu T; Zhang A; Qin J; Zhang Y; Qian X,Biomedicines,2024,Oct,Biomedicines. 2024 Oct 16;12(10):2360. doi: 10.3390/biomedicines12102360.,Switzerland,345,11504882
35204468,"Diagnostic Strategy of Early Stage Pancreatic Cancer via Clinical Predictor Assessment: Clinical Indicators, Risk Factors and Imaging Findings.","Early detection of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) in the general population is difficult due to unknown clinical characteristics. This study was conducted to clarify the factors associated with early stage PDAC. Well-known symptoms and factors associated with PDAC were classified into clinical indicators, risk factors, and imaging findings concomitant with early stage PDAC. To analyze these factors for the detection of patients with early stage PDAC compared to patients without PDAC, we constructed new diagnostic strategies. The factors of 35 patients with early stage PDAC (stage 0 and IA) and 801 patients without PDAC were compared retrospectively. Clinical indicators; presence and number of indicators, elevated pancreatic enzyme level, tumor biomarker level, acute pancreatitis history, risk factors; familial pancreatic cancer, diabetes mellitus, smoking history, imaging findings; presence and number of findings, and main pancreatic duct dilation were significant factors for early stage PDAC detection. A new screening strategy to select patients who should be examined by imaging modalities from evaluating clinical indicators and risk factors and approaching a definitive diagnosis by evaluating imaging findings had a relatively high sensitivity, specificity, and areas under the curve of 80.0%, 80.8%, and 0.80, respectively. Diagnosis based on the new category and strategy may be reasonable for early stage PDAC detection.",,Sagami R; Sato T; Mizukami K; Motomura M; Okamoto K; Fukuchi S; Otsuka Y; Abe T; Ono H; Mori K; Wada K; Iwaki T; Nishikiori H; Honda K; Amano Y; Murakami K,"Diagnostics (Basel, Switzerland)",2022,Feb,Diagnostics (Basel). 2022 Feb 1;12(2):377. doi: 10.3390/diagnostics12020377.,Switzerland,318,8871200
33505144,Oral microbiome and pancreatic cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Microbiota profiles differ between patients with pancreatic cancer and healthy people, and understanding these differences may help in early detection of pancreatic cancer. Saliva sampling is an easy and cost-effective way to determine microbiota profiles compared to fecal and tissue sample collection. AIM: To investigate the saliva microbiome distribution in patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and the role of oral microbiota profiles in detection and risk prediction of pancreatic cancer. METHODS: We conducted a prospective study of patients with pancreatic cancer (n = 41) and healthy individuals (n = 69). Bacterial taxa were identified by 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid gene sequencing, and a linear discriminant analysis effect size algorithm was used to identify differences in taxa. Operational taxonomic unit values of all selected taxa were converted into a normalized Z-score, and logistic regressions were used to calculate risk prediction of pancreatic cancer. RESULTS: Compared with the healthy control group, carriage of Streptococcus and Leptotrichina (z-score) was associated with a higher risk of PDAC [odds ratio (OR) = 5.344, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.282-22.282, P = 0.021 and OR = 6.886, 95%CI: 1.423-33.337, P = 0.016, respectively]. Veillonella and Neisseria (z-score) were considered a protective microbe that decreased the risk of PDAC (OR = 0.187, 95%CI: 0.055-0.631, P = 0.007 and OR = 0.309, 95%CI: 0.100-0.952, P = 0.041, respectively). Among the patients with PDAC, patients reporting bloating have a higher abundance of Porphyromonas (P = 0.039), Fusobacterium (P = 0.024), and Alloprevotella (P = 0.041); while patients reporting jaundice had a higher amount of Prevotella (P = 0.008); patients reporting dark brown urine had a higher amount of Veillonella (P = 0.035). Patients reporting diarrhea had a lower amount of Neisseria and Campylobacter (P = 0.024 and P = 0.034), and patients reporting vomiting had decreased Alloprevotella (P = 0.036). CONCLUSION: Saliva microbiome was able to distinguish patients with pancreatic cancer and healthy individuals. Leptotrichia may be specific for patients living in Sichuan Province, southwest China. Symptomatic patients had different bacteria profiles than asymptomatic patients. Combined symptom and microbiome evaluation may help in the early detection of pancreatic cancer.","*Adenocarcinoma; China; Humans; *Microbiota; *Pancreatic Neoplasms; Prospective Studies; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S/genetics; Saliva",Wei AL; Li M; Li GQ; Wang X; Hu WM; Li ZL; Yuan J; Liu HY; Zhou LL; Li K; Li A; Fu MR,World journal of gastroenterology,2020,Dec,World J Gastroenterol. 2020 Dec 28;26(48):7679-7692. doi: 10.3748/wjg.v26.i48.7679.,United States,450,7789059
36564539,Health state utility values for metastatic pancreatic cancer using a composite time trade-off based on the vignette-based approach in Japan.,"BACKGROUNDS: Limited information is available on the utility values of metastatic pancreatic cancer, focusing on different health statuses, selected chemotherapy, and related grades 1/2 and 3/4 adverse events (AEs). We evaluated Japanese societal-based health-related utility values for metastatic pancreatic cancer by considering different grade toxicities commonly associated with chemotherapy using the vignette-based method. METHODS: We developed health status scenarios for patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer undergoing chemotherapy and conducted utility research using the developed scenarios in four steps: 'literature review,' 'exploratory interview,' 'content validation', and 'utility research'. In the development process, to consider the impact of AEs of chemotherapy for metastatic pancreatic cancer on health state utility values, we selected neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, and neuropathy as representative AEs. Each AE was classified as either grade 1/2 or 3/4. We confirmed our created scenarios through cognitive interviews with the general population and clinical experts to validate the content. Finally, we developed 11 scenarios for using 'utility research,' evaluated in a societal-based valuation study using the face-to-face method. Participants for 'utility research' were the general population, and they evaluated these scenarios in the composite time trade-off (cTTO) and visual analog scale (VAS) of the European quality of life (EuroQol) valuation technology to derive health state utility scores. RESULTS: Of 220 responders who completed this survey, 201 were adapted into the analysis population. Stable disease with no AEs (reference state) had a mean utility value of 0.653 using cTTO. The lowest mean utility score in the stable state was 0.242 (stable disease + grade 3/4 vomiting). VAS results ranged from 0.189 to 0.468, depending on the various grades of AEs in stable disease. In addition, grade 3/4 AEs and grade 1/2 nausea/vomiting were associated with significantly greater disutility. Utility values were also strongly influenced by the direct impact of AE on physical symptoms, severity and their experience. In addition, 95.9% of the respondents agreed that they understood the questions in the post-response questionnaire. CONCLUSIONS: We clarified the health state utility values of patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer based on the general population in Japan. The effect on utilities should be considered not only for serious AEs, but also for minor AEs.",,Takumoto Y; Sasahara Y; Narimatsu H; Murata T; Akazawa M,Health economics review,2022,Dec,Health Econ Rev. 2022 Dec 24;12(1):63. doi: 10.1186/s13561-022-00413-8.,Germany,452,9789314
40235863,Efficacy and safety of early pancreatic duct stenting for unresectable pancreatic cancer: A randomized controlled trial.,"BACKGROUND: Palliative care for unresectable pancreatic cancer (PC) focuses mainly on the symptoms of the disease, including abdominal pain, obstructive jaundice, and malnutrition. Biliary stent placement using endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) to relieve biliary obstruction has become an internationally recognized treatment. Although a few studies have evaluated the efficacy of endoscopic pancreatic duct stenting in advanced PC, no consensus exists on the use of endoscopic treatment to relieve pain and improve nutritional status. AIM: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of early pancreatic duct stenting in patients with unresectable PC. METHODS: Patients with unresectable PC were recruited. The participants were randomized into two groups: The double-stent group underwent ERCP with a fully-covered self-expandable metallic biliary stent (FCSEMS) and a pancreatic duct stent, while the single-stent group underwent ERCP with an FCSEMS only. Abdominal pain, nutritional status, and incidence of adverse events were compared between the two groups using the SPSS software. RESULTS: Seventy-eight patients with unresectable PC were included in the analysis (40 and 38 in the double- and single-stent groups, respectively). The median pain scores of patients in the double-stent group were lower than those in the single-stent group at 1 (0 vs 2.5, P = 0.002), 2 (0 vs 3, P < 0.001), 3 (0 vs 4, P < 0.001), and 6 months (0 vs 4, P < 0.001) after ERCP. Total serum protein levels in patients in the double-stent group were higher than those in the single-stent group (66.6 +/- 8.4 g/L vs 60.4 +/- 4.0 g/L, P = 0.046) 6 months postoperatively. The body mass index (BMI) of patients in both groups decreased at six months. However, the BMI in the single-stent group was higher than that in the double-stent group (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Early pancreatic duct stenting reduces abdominal pain and improves nutritional status in patients with unresectable PC without reducing the technical success rate or increasing the incidence of adverse events.",,Sun MH; Shen HZ; Jin HB; Yang JF; Zhang XF,World journal of gastrointestinal oncology,2025,Apr,World J Gastrointest Oncol. 2025 Apr 15;17(4):103311. doi: 10.4251/wjgo.v17.i4.103311.,China,352,11995310
39398405,An Overview of Pancreatic Cancer Diagnosis and Treatment in China: Current Landscape and Future Prospects.,"This comprehensive literature review is to summarize the most recent findings regarding the causes, diagnosis, and treatments of pancreatic cancer and to encourage additional investigation into this under-researched malignant tumor. Pancreatic cancer is a significant public health issue in China, with annual mortality rates almost equal to incidence rates. The disease is more prevalent in rural areas and has a poor prognosis. The data was collected from the following databases: Pub Med, Cross ref, Science Direct, Scopus, and Google Scholar we reviewed published articles from 2018 to 2023 on the annual incidence of pancreatic cancer in China is 5.1%, with only 5-7% of patients completely cured. The prognosis is extremely poor, with a 1-year survival rate of 8% and a 5-year survival rate of 3%. Pancreatic cancer has no specific clinical manifestations or tumor markers, and its characteristics are not typical of high-risk factors including smoking, alcohol, chronic pancreatitis, abnormal microorganism metabolism, blood type, and glucose and lipid levels. For increased detection and survival rates, pancreatic cancer must be diagnosed as early as possible. However, the low specificity of tumor markers calls for more study. Future treatment strategies could include immunotherapy and a microbiology-free system, and it's anticipated that they'll offer intriguing clinical applications for extending patients' lives with pancreatic cancer. Finally, we suggest measures to improve the health outcomes of pancreatic cancer patients in China.",,Hidig SM,Nigerian medical journal : journal of the Nigeria Medical Association,2024,Jul-Aug,Niger Med J. 2024 Sep 26;65(4):387-397. doi: 10.60787/nmj-v65i3-376. eCollection 2024 Jul-Aug.,Nigeria,464,11470284
35596182,Health-related quality of life scores of metastatic pancreatic cancer patients responsive to first line chemotherapy compared to newly derived EORTC QLQ-C30 reference values.,"BACKGROUND: Metastatic pancreatic cancer (mPC) and its treatments significantly impact health-related quality of life (HRQoL). POLO, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial evaluated the efficacy of olaparib as maintenance therapy in germline BRCA mutated mPC patients who had not progressed during >/=16 weeks of first-line platinum-based chemotherapy. HRQoL was assessed using the EORTC QLQ-C30. To enhance score interpretation, we derived reference values for treatment-naive mPC patients from the literature. METHODS: A targeted literature review identified EORTC QLQ-C30 baseline values in treatment-naive mPC patients. Reference values were calculated by deriving means from studies meeting inclusion criteria, with scores from 0 to 100 (higher scores indicate better QoL/functioning but worse symptoms). For POLO patients, means were calculated using pooled baseline data across study arms. RESULTS: Four studies met inclusion criteria. Depending on the specific scale, sample sizes ranged from n = 466 to n = 639. Compared to newly derived reference values, POLO patients reported markedly better HRQoL scores at baseline across most scales, with eight scales showing differences of >/=10 points. POLO patients' HRQoL scores were often close to or better than general population norm data. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to systematically derive EORTC QLQ-C30 reference values for mPC. POLO patients had better HRQoL scores than those in the literature and similar to general population data. Comparatively high HRQoL of POLO patients are likely due to effects of prior first-line treatment and resolution of chemotherapy-related symptoms, response shift, or a combination. Newly derived reference values can enhance interpretation of mPC patients' HRQoL.

27484349,Radiation recall gastritis secondary to combination of gemcitabine and erlotinib in pancreatic cancer and response to PPI - a case report.,"BACKGROUND: Radiation recall gastritis is rare but can be induced after concurrent chemoradiation for pancreatic cancer. We report a patient with pancreatic cancer who developed radiation-recall gastritis related to a combination of gemcitabine and erlotinib. CASE PRESENTATION: A 54-year-old female with unresectable pancreatic cancer received gemcitabine in combination with radiation therapy followed by chemotherapy with gemcitabine and erlotinib. After completing 2 cycles of chemotherapy, the patient had epigastric pain, nausea, and vomiting. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan revealed diffuse wall thickening of the stomach, and esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) showed multiple gastric ulcers. The patient was treated with proton pump inhibitors (PPI) and was continued on maintenance chemotherapy. Two months later, the patient presented with the similar symptoms and persistent gastric ulcers were observed during subsequent EGD. Nevertheless, the patient's symptom had resolved with PPI therapy. Thus, the patient underwent maintenance chemotherapy with gemcitabine and erlotinib for additional 4 cycles. Eventually, follow-up abdominal CT Scan and EGD at 6 months demonstrated resolution of the gastric ulcers. CONCLUSIONS: Physicians should be aware of the possibility of radiation recall gastritis associated with a combination of gemcitabine and erlotinib. Administration of PPIs may mitigate the adverse effects of gemcitabine and erlotinib in the presence of radiation recall gastritis; however further studies are warranted.","Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use; Chemoradiotherapy/*adverse effects; Deoxycytidine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use; Endoscopy, Digestive System; Erlotinib Hydrochloride/administration & dosage/therapeutic use; Female; Gastritis/*diagnostic imaging/etiology; Humans; Maintenance Chemotherapy; Middle Aged; Pancreatic Neoplasms/*therapy; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Treatment Outcome; Gemcitabine",Choi SJ; Kim HJ; Kim JS; Bak YT; Kim JS,BMC cancer,2016,Aug,BMC Cancer. 2016 Aug 2;16:588. doi: 10.1186/s12885-016-2616-3.,England,276,4971692
37510480,Preoperative Anxiety in Patients with Pancreatic Cancer: What Contributes to Anxiety Levels in Patients Waiting for Surgical Intervention.,"Pancreatic cancer is one of the most lethal malignancies. Currently, the only treatment is surgical resection, which contributes to significant preoperative anxiety, reducing quality of life and worsening surgical outcomes. To date, no standard preventive or therapeutic methods have been established for preoperative anxiety in pancreatic patients. This observational study aims to identify which patients' socio-demographic, clinical and psychological characteristics contribute more to preoperative anxiety and to identify which are their preoperative concerns. Preoperative anxiety was assessed the day before surgery in 104 selected cancer patients undergoing similar pancreatic major surgery, by administering the STAI-S (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory Form) and the APAIS (Amsterdam Preoperative Anxiety and Information Scale). Our data suggest that patients with high STAI-S showed higher levels of APAIS and that major concerns were related to surgical aspects. Among psychological characteristics, depressive symptoms and trait anxiety appeared as risk factors for the development of preoperative anxiety. Findings support the utility of planning a specific psychological screening to identify patients who need more help, with the aim of offering support and preventing the development of state anxiety and surgery worries in the preoperative phase. This highlights also the importance of good communication by the surgeon on specific aspects related to the operation.",,Marinelli V; Mazzi MA; Rimondini M; Danzi OP; Bonamini D; Bassi C; Salvia R; Del Piccolo L,"Healthcare (Basel, Switzerland)",2023,Jul,Healthcare (Basel). 2023 Jul 17;11(14):2039. doi: 10.3390/healthcare11142039.,Switzerland,404,10380009
40122779,Pancreatic Cancer Patients Supportive Care Needs: A Qualitative Analysis.,"OBJECTIVE: Pancreatic cancer (PaCa) patients face a 5-year survival rate of just 13%. Most patients present with unresectable disease and endure aggressive treatments with significant chronic and debilitating side effects. PaCa patients also experience significant unmet supportive care needs (e.g., physical, psychological, informational/educational); however, limited qualitative studies have explored the specific needs of racially and ethnically diverse PaCa populations. AIMS: This study identified supportive care needs in a racially and ethnically diverse sample of PaCa survivors. METHODS: As part of a larger project to develop a psychosocial symptom management intervention, semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted with PaCa survivors to explore the supportive care needs at diagnosis and after treatment. Qualitative data were analyzed using Rapid Qualitative Analysis, and personal/medical characteristics were analyzed using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: PaCa survivors (n = 18; M(age) = 64) participated, with the majority identifying as female (66.7%), White (88.9%), and Hispanic (55.6%). Over one-third completed interviews in Spanish. Four themes emerged: (1) information/health system needs, including difficulty understanding complex medical concepts, limited holistic care, post-treatment symptom management, and health behaviors; (2) psychosocial needs related to quality of life and relationships with family and healthcare providers; (3) physical and functional needs, including persistent side effects and lifestyle changes; and (4) positivity and gratitude. CONCLUSIONS: We emphasize the themes of unmet supportive care needs in a racially and ethnically diverse sample of PaCa survivors. These findings underscore the importance of developing interventions to address these gaps and improve the overall quality of life for diverse PaCa patients.",Humans; Female; Male; Qualitative Research; *Pancreatic Neoplasms/psychology/therapy; Middle Aged; Aged; *Social Support; Quality of Life/psychology; Needs Assessment; *Health Services Needs and Demand; *Cancer Survivors/psychology; Adult; *Survivors/psychology,Fleszar-Pavlovic SE; Benzo RM; Gong R; Browder A; Nawab A; Brito AE; Merchant NB; Penedo FJ,Psycho-oncology,2025,Mar,Psychooncology. 2025 Mar;34(3):e70135. doi: 10.1002/pon.70135.,England,340,11930888
37173913,Diagnostic Bioliquid Markers for Pancreatic Cancer: What We Have vs. What We Need.,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), the most common type of pancreatic cancer, currently has a dismal five-year survival rate of approximately 10% due to late diagnosis and a lack of efficient treatment options such as surgery. Furthermore, the majority of PDAC patients have surgically unresectable cancer, meaning cancer cells have either reached the surrounding blood vessels or metastasized to other organs distant from the pancreas area, resulting in low survival rates as compared to other types of cancers. In contrast, the five-year survival rate of surgically resectable PDAC patients is currently 44%. The late diagnosis of PDAC is a result of little or no symptoms in its early stage of development and a lack of specific biomarkers that may be utilized in routine examinations in the clinic. Although healthcare professionals understand the importance of early detection of PDAC, the research on the subject has lagged and no significant changes in the death toll of PDAC patients has been observed. This review is focused on understanding potential biomarkers that may increase the early diagnosis of PDAC patients at its surgically resectable stage. Here, we summarize the currently available biomarkers used in the clinic as well as those being developed with the hope of providing insight into the future of liquid biomarkers to be used in routine examinations for the early diagnosis of PDAC.",,Liou GY; Byrd CJ,Cancers,2023,Apr,Cancers (Basel). 2023 Apr 25;15(9):2446. doi: 10.3390/cancers15092446.,Switzerland,777,10177101
37031291,Oncolytic adenoviruses and the treatment of pancreatic cancer: a review of clinical trials.,"PURPOSE: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains a common and difficult cancer to treat. Surgical resection and chemotherapy are standard of care and clinical outcomes remain poor. Oncolytic adenoviruses are a unique approach to the treatment of this challenging cancer, aiming to overcome the features of this disease that pose the key obstacles to standard therapies. This paper provides a detailed review of the clinical trials of conditionally-replicative adenoviruses in pancreatic cancer to date, with a brief summary of the past preclinical literature and future prospects of this therapy. METHODS: MEDLINE, Embase, and clinicaltrials.gov were searched from inception to December 23rd 2022 for clinical trials of conditionally-replicative adenoviruses used in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Primary features for review included patient demographics, treatment protocol including dose and administration route, adverse events, patient responses and survival rates. RESULTS: The six published clinical trials suggest that objective clinical responses can be achieved with a tolerable level of side effects, even at high viral doses. The more clinically adaptable intravenous route of administration also appears to be as well tolerated as the more challenging intratumoural injections. CONCLUSION: Published clinical trials provide data of the safety and some signs of oncolytic activity of conditionally-replicative adenoviruses in patients with pancreatic cancer. Importantly, on the latest trials, the easier intravenous route of administration seems to be well tolerated and safe, providing the opportunity for further clinical evaluation. It is hoped that the ongoing clinical trials will yield more promising results of this therapeutic approach against a currently intractable disease.","Humans; Adenoviridae/genetics; *Carcinoma, Pancreatic Ductal/therapy; *Oncolytic Virotherapy/methods; *Oncolytic Viruses/genetics; *Pancreatic Neoplasms/drug therapy; Clinical Trials as Topic",Taylor IP; Lopez JA,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,2023,Aug,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 2023 Aug;149(10):8117-8129. doi: 10.1007/s00432-023-04735-w.

34898585,Novel Therapeutic Method for Unresectable Pancreatic Cancer-The Impact of the Long-Term Research in Therapeutic Effect of High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) Therapy.,"High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is a novel advanced therapy for unresectable pancreatic cancer (PC). HIFU therapy with chemotherapy is being promoted as a novel method to control local advancement by tumor ablation. We evaluated the therapeutic effects of HIFU therapy in locally advanced and metastatic PC. PC patients were treated with HIFU as an optional local therapy and systemic chemotherapy. The FEP-BY02 (Yuande Bio-Medical Engineering) HIFU device was used under ultrasound guidance. Of 176 PC patients, 89 cases were Stage III and 87 were Stage IV. The rate of complete tumor ablation was 90.3%, while that of symptom relief was 66.7%. The effectiveness on the primary lesions were as follows: complete response (CR): n = 0, partial response (PR): n = 21, stable disease (SD): n = 106, and progressive disease (PD): n = 49; the primary disease control rate was 72.2%. Eight patients underwent surgery. The median survival time (MST) after diagnosis for HIFU with chemotherapy compared to chemotherapy alone (100 patients in our hospital) was 648 vs. 288 days (p < 0.001). Compared with chemotherapy alone, the combination of HIFU therapy and chemotherapy demonstrated significant prolongation of prognosis. This study suggests that HIFU therapy has the potential to be a novel combination therapy for unresectable PC.",Combined Modality Therapy; *Extracorporeal Shockwave Therapy; *High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound Ablation/adverse effects/methods; Humans; *Pancreatic Neoplasms/pathology,Sofuni A; Asai Y; Tsuchiya T; Ishii K; Tanaka R; Tonozuka R; Honjo M; Mukai S; Nagai K; Yamamoto K; Matsunami Y; Kurosawa T; Kojima H; Homma T; Minami H; Nakatsubo R; Hirakawa N; Miyazawa H; Nagakawa Y; Tsuchida A; Itoi T,"Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2021,Nov,Curr Oncol. 2021 Nov 20;28(6):4845-4861. doi: 10.3390/curroncol28060409.,Switzerland,412,8628685
34762217,Quality of life of locally advanced pancreatic cancer patients after FOLFIRINOX treatment.,"BACKGROUND: Quality of life in cancer patients might be affected by chemotherapy-induced toxicity. Especially in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), with a short life expectancy, fear of poor quality of life is often a reason for both patients and medical oncologists to refrain from further treatment. In this study, we investigated quality of life (QoL), pain, sleep, and activity levels in locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC) patients after FOLFIRINOX treatment. METHODS: A total of 41 LAPC patients with stable disease or partial response were included after completion of at least four cycles of FOLFIRINOX. QoL was measured with the EORTC QLQ-C30 and NRS pain scores. Patients completed the Richards-Campbell Sleep Questionnaire (RCSQ) for five consecutive nights and wore a GENEActiv tri-axial accelerometer (Actiwatch) for 7 days, registering sleep duration, efficiency, and activity. RESULTS: Mean EORTC QLQ-C30 score for global health status was 78.3 (+/- 17.3), higher than reference values for cancer patients (P < 0.001) and general population (P = 0.045). LAPC patients reported few disease-related symptoms. Two patients (5%) reported pain scores > 3. Mean sleep duration was 8 h/night (+/- 1.2 h) and sleep efficiency 70% (+/- 9%) with high patient-reported quality of sleep (mean RCSQ score 72.0 +/- 11.4). Mean duration of moderate-vigorous activity was 37 min/week (+/- 103 min/week). CONCLUSIONS: QoL is very good in most LAPC patients with disease control after FOLFIRINOX, measured with validated questionnaires and Actiwatch registration. The fear of clinical deterioration after FOLFIRINOX is not substantiated by this study and should not be a reason to refrain from treatment.

40568369,Advanced Detection of Pancreatic Cancer Circulating Tumor Cells Using Biomarkers and Magnetic Particle Spectroscopy.,"Background: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) typically develops without symptoms, and its aggressive progression combined with late-stage diagnosis underscores the critical need for improved early detection strategies. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in blood are potential biomarkers for PDAC. In this study, the detection of pancreatic cancer-associated CTCs was evaluated using two magnetic-based diagnostic systems in a comparative approach. Methods: Two distinct nanotheranostic platforms were developed: monoclonal antibody-conjugated magnetic nanoparticles (mAbs-MNPs) and magnetized exosomes (termed Magxosomes). Anti-mesothelin and anti-vimentin were used as monoclonal antibodies, while mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) treated with MNPs served as the source of Magxosomes. Characterization of nano-systems was performed using dynamic light scattering (DLS), inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Blood samples were collected from pancreatic cancer mouse models, treated with nanotheranostic platforms, and analyzed using a homemade magnetic particle spectroscopy (MPS) device. Results: The detection of pancreatic cancer-associated CTCs was investigated using nanotheranostic platforms alongside an MPS instrument. In this context, the mAbs-MNPs systems demonstrated varying efficiencies in the diagnosis of CTCs, with Ant-V-MNPs (anti-vimentin conjugated MNPs) achieving 27.47%, Ant-M-MNPs (anti-mesothelin conjugated MNPs) at 13.59%, and a 50:50 mixture of Ant-M-MNPs: Ant-V-MNPs showing an efficiency of 19.73%. Conversely, the efficiencies of Magxosomes were notably higher. Bone marrow stem cell (BMSC)-derived Magxosomes achieved an average efficiency of 63.39%, while adipose-derived stem cell (ADSC)-derived Magxosomes exhibited an average efficiency of 56.23%. Conclusions: This study introduces a promising method for early pancreatic cancer diagnosis by detecting CTCs in blood. It employs a non-invasive, rapid test using an advanced MPS instrument (1 ng detection limit) and nanotheranostic platforms. Results confirm the system's robustness in identifying pancreatic cancer CTCs. This approach may support future developments in cancer diagnostics and monitoring.","*Neoplastic Cells, Circulating/pathology/metabolism; *Pancreatic Neoplasms/pathology/blood/diagnosis; Animals; Mice; *Biomarkers, Tumor/blood; Humans; *Magnetite Nanoparticles/chemistry; Exosomes/chemistry; Cell Line, Tumor; Antibodies, Monoclonal/chemistry; *Carcinoma, Pancreatic Ductal/blood/diagnosis/pathology; Mesenchymal Stem Cells; Spectrum Analysis/methods",Dinari A; Ahmad HA; Oh S; Kim YH; Yoon J,Nanotheranostics,2025,,Nanotheranostics. 2025 Jun 12;9(2):171-185. doi: 10.7150/ntno.110074. eCollection 2025.,Australia,537,12188535
37022483,The impact of early palliative care on the quality of life of patients with advanced pancreatic cancer: The IMPERATIVE case-crossover study.,"PURPOSE: Pancreatic cancer is a lethal disease. Many patients experience a heavy burden of cancer-associated symptoms and poor quality of life (QOL). Early palliative care alongside standard oncologic care results in improved QOL and survival in some cancer types. The benefit in advanced pancreatic cancer (APC) is not fully quantified. METHODS: In this prospective case-crossover study, patients >/= 18 years old with APC were recruited from ambulatory clinics at a tertiary cancer center. Patients underwent a palliative care consultation within 2 weeks of registration, with follow up visits every 2 weeks for the first month, then every 4 weeks until week 16, then as needed. The primary outcome was change in QOL between baseline (BL) and week 16, measured by Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - hepatobiliary (FACT-Hep). Secondary outcomes included symptom control (ESAS-r), depression, and anxiety (HADS, PHQ-9) at week 16. RESULTS: Of 40 patients, 25 (63%) were male, 28 (70%) had metastatic disease, 31 (78%) had ECOG performance status 0-1, 31 (78%) received chemotherapy. Median age was 70. Mean FACT-hep score at BL was 118.8, compared to 125.7 at week 16 (mean change 6.89, [95%CI (-1.69-15.6); p = 0.11]). On multivariable analysis, metastatic disease (mean change 15.3 [95%CI (5.3-25.2); p = 0.004]) and age < 70 (mean change 12.9 [95%CI (0.5-25.4); p = 0.04]) were associated with improved QOL. Patients with metastatic disease had significant improvement in symptom burden (mean change -7.4 [95%CI (-13.4 to -1.4); p = 0.02]). There was no difference in depression or anxiety from BL to week 16. CONCLUSION: Palliative care should be integrated early in the journey for patients with APC, as it can improve QOL and symptom burden.

38891809,Identifying the Morphological and Molecular Features of a Cell-Based Orthotopic Pancreatic Cancer Mouse Model during Growth over Time.,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), characterized by hypovascularity, hypoxia, and desmoplastic stroma is one of the deadliest malignancies in humans, with a 5-year survival rate of only 7%. The anatomical location of the pancreas and lack of symptoms in patients with early onset of disease accounts for late diagnosis. Consequently, 85% of patients present with non-resectable, locally advanced, or advanced metastatic disease at diagnosis and rely on alternative therapies such as chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and others. The response to these therapies highly depends on the stage of disease at the start of therapy. It is, therefore, vital to consider the stages of PDAC models in preclinical studies when testing new therapeutics and treatment modalities. We report a standardized induction of cell-based orthotopic pancreatic cancer models in mice and the identification of vital features of their progression by ultrasound imaging and histological analysis of the level of pancreatic stellate cells, mature fibroblasts, and collagen. The results highlight that early-stage primary tumors are secluded in the pancreas and advance towards infiltrating the omentum at week 5-7 post implantation of the BxPC-3 and Panc-1 models investigated. Late stages show extensive growth, the infiltration of the omentum and/or stomach wall, metastases, augmented fibroblasts, and collagen levels. The findings can serve as suggestions for defining growth parameter-based stages of orthotopic pancreatic cancer models for the preclinical testing of drug efficacy in the future.","Animals; *Pancreatic Neoplasms/pathology/metabolism/genetics; Mice; *Carcinoma, Pancreatic Ductal/pathology/metabolism; Humans; *Disease Models, Animal; Cell Line, Tumor",Tansi FL; Schrepper A; Schwarzer M; Teichgraber U; Hilger I,International journal of molecular sciences,2024,May,Int J Mol Sci. 2024 May 22;25(11):5619. doi: 10.3390/ijms25115619.,Switzerland,341,11171605
31641536,Benefits of non-invasive methods compared to telemetry for distress analysis in a murine model of pancreatic cancer.,"Prospective severity assessment is legally required in many countries to ensure high-quality research along with high welfare standards for laboratory animals. Mice and rats, the most common laboratory species, are prey animals that usually suppress signs of pain and suffering. Therefore, highly sensitive readout parameters are necessary to adequately quantify distress. The present study compared the performance of different non-invasive methods in determining animal distress, such as measuring body weight, distress score, faecal corticosterone metabolites, burrowing, and nesting behaviour, with continuous monitoring of heart rate, body temperature and activity by telemetry. The distress caused by two surgical interventions was compared and the burden caused by tumour growth was described. Transmitter implantation caused higher distress than laparotomy plus carcinoma cell injection into the pancreas. Surprisingly, no significant increase in distress was observed during tumour growth. The receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed that some non-invasive distress-parameters, i.e., distress-score and burrowing activity, exhibited slightly better performance to quantify distress than the most suitable parameters measured by telemetry. Due to the high burden caused by the implantation of the telemetric device, the use of non-invasive methods to assess distress in laboratory animals after surgical interventions should be favoured in future studies.",,Kumstel S; Vasudevan P; Palme R; Zhang X; Wendt EHU; David R; Vollmar B; Zechner D,Journal of advanced research,2020,Mar,J Adv Res. 2019 Sep 14;21:35-47. doi: 10.1016/j.jare.2019.09.002. eCollection 2020 Mar.,Egypt,364,6796693
37014692,"Management of Pain and Cachexia in Pancreatic Cancer: Protocol for Two Systematic Reviews, Network Meta-Analysis, Surveys, and Focus Groups.","BACKGROUND:  Approximately 75% of people with pancreatic cancer experience pain, and >50% of them have cachexia (weakness and wasting of the body). However, there is considerable uncertainty regarding the management of these distressing symptoms. OBJECTIVE:  Our primary objectives are to compare the relative benefits and harms of different interventions for pain in people with unresectable pancreatic cancer and for prevention and treatment of cachexia due to pancreatic cancer, through systematic reviews and network meta-analysis. Our secondary objectives are to develop an evidence-based clinical care pathway to manage pain and prevent and treat cachexia in people with pancreatic cancer through surveys and focus groups involving patients, carers, and health care professionals. METHODS:  We will perform 2 systematic reviews of the literature related to pain and cachexia in people with pancreatic cancer using searches from Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index, and trial registries. Two researchers will independently screen for eligibility and identify randomized controlled trials (no language or publication status restriction), comparing interventions for pain or cachexia based on full-texts for articles shortlisted during screening. We will assess risk of bias in the trials using the Cochrane risk of bias tool (version 2.0) and obtain data related to baseline prognostic characteristics, potential effect modifiers and outcome data related to overall survival, health-related quality of life, treatment-related complications, and resource utilisation. We aim to conduct network meta-analysis on outcomes with multiple treatment comparisons where possible, otherwise, meta-analysis with direct comparisons, or narrative synthesis. We will perform various subgroup and sensitivity analyses. Using information obtained from both systematic reviews, we will conduct 2 surveys: one directed to patients or carers to assess acceptability of interventions, and the other to health care professionals to assess feasibility of delivery in the National Health Service. Four mixed focus groups will be conducted to evaluate findings and foster consensus in the development of the care pathway. RESULTS:  Funding was awarded from April 2022 (NIHR202727). Both systematic review protocols were prospectively registered on PROSPERO in May 2022. Formal searches began thereafter. Approval by the University College London Research Ethics Committee (23563/001) was received in December 2022. Data collection began in January 2023; data analysis will begin in May 2023 (completion expected by October 2023). CONCLUSIONS:  This study will comprehensively encompass major interventions for management of pain in people with unresectable pancreatic cancer, and prevention and treatment of cachexia in people with pancreatic cancer. Key stakeholders will facilitate the development of an evidence-based care pathway, ensuring both acceptability and feasibility. The project ends in April 2024 and published results are expected within 12 months of completion. We aim to present the findings through patient group websites, conferences, and publications, irrespective of the findings, in a peer-reviewed journal.

29304816,Extracellular vesicles as mediators of the progression and chemoresistance of pancreatic cancer and their potential clinical applications.,"Pancreatic cancer is one of the most lethal cancers worldwide due to its insidious symptoms, early metastasis, and chemoresistance. Hence, the underlying mechanisms contributing to pancreatic cancer progression require further exploration. Based on accumulating evidence, extracellular vesicles, including exosomes and microvesicles, play a crucial role in pancreatic cancer progression and chemoresistance. Furthermore, they also possess the potential to be promising biomarkers, therapy targets and tools for treating pancreatic cancer. Therefore, in-depth studies on the role of extracellular vesicles in pancreatic cancer are meaningful. In this review, we focus on the regulatory effects of extracellular vesicles on pancreatic cancer progression, metastasis, cancer-related immunity and chemoresistance, particularly their potential roles as biomarkers and therapeutic targets.","Biomarkers; Cell Movement/genetics; Cell Proliferation; Cell-Derived Microparticles; Disease Progression; *Drug Resistance, Neoplasm; Extracellular Matrix/metabolism; Extracellular Vesicles/*metabolism; Humans; Immune Tolerance; Immunologic Surveillance; Neoplasm Metastasis; Pancreatic Neoplasms/diagnosis/drug therapy/immunology/*metabolism; Prognosis; Tumor Microenvironment",Qiu J; Yang G; Feng M; Zheng S; Cao Z; You L; Zheng L; Zhang T; Zhao Y,Molecular cancer,2018,Jan,Mol Cancer. 2018 Jan 5;17(1):2. doi: 10.1186/s12943-017-0755-z.,England,184,5756395
35634485,Endoscopic ultrasound guided interventions in the management of pancreatic cancer.,"There has been a growing interest in developing endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided interventions for pancreatic cancer, some of which have become standard of care. There are two main factors that drive these advancements to facilitate treatment of patients with pancreatic cancer, ranging from direct locoregional therapy to palliation of symptoms related to inoperable pancreatic cancer. Firstly, an upper EUS has the capability to access the entire pancreas-lesions in the pancreatic head and uncinate process can be accessed from the duodenum, and lesions in the pancreatic body and tail can be accessed from the stomach. Secondly, there has been a robust development of devices that allow through-the-needle interventions, such as placement of fiducial markers, brachytherapy, intratumoral injection, gastroenterostomy creation, and ablation. While these techniques are rapidly emerging, data from a multicenter randomized controlled trial for some procedures are awaited prior to their adoption in clinical settings.",,Kerdsirichairat T; Shin EJ,World journal of gastrointestinal endoscopy,2022,Apr,World J Gastrointest Endosc. 2022 Apr 16;14(4):191-204. doi: 10.4253/wjge.v14.i4.191.,United States,263,9048490
38738113,A Unique Case of a Patient With Pancreatic Cancer Developing Leptomeningeal Metastases While on Gemcitabine and Nab-Paclitaxel.,"Brain metastases and leptomeningeal disease are rare with pancreatic cancer. Leptomeningeal disease is a catastrophic complication to have as patients deteriorate rapidly. Patients can present with symptoms of cranial nerve neuropathies, headache, nausea, and focal neurological deficits. We present a patient with metastatic pancreatic cancer who was treated initially with FOLFIRINOX (5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin) which resulted in marked clinical and radiologic improvement. However, he started to develop severe peripheral neuropathy and was switched to maintenance gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel. On this regimen, his systemic disease was well controlled but he developed leptomeningeal carcinomatosis. To our knowledge, this is the first case of leptomeningeal metastases developing in a patient with pancreatic adenocarcinoma while on treatment with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel after cessation of FOLFIRINOX. We should maintain high clinical suspicion for leptomeningeal disease in pancreatic cancer, especially when systemic disease is well controlled, as the chemotherapeutic agents may not be crossing the blood-brain barrier effectively contributing to high morbidity and mortality.",,Chemarthi VS; Guron G; Shaaban H,Cureus,2024,Apr,Cureus. 2024 Apr 12;16(4):e58139. doi: 10.7759/cureus.58139. eCollection 2024 Apr.,United States,282,11088938
31811561,Long-term proton pump inhibitor usage and the association with pancreatic cancer in Sweden.,"BACKGROUND: The long-term safety of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) is increasingly questioned. The aim of our study was to assess the risk of pancreatic cancer among long-term PPI users in Sweden. METHODS: This population-based nationwide Swedish cohort study including 796,492 adult long-term PPI users has been used to calculate the standardized incidence rate ratios (SIRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for pancreatic cancer, stratifying by indications of use, age, sex, and duration of use. The risk among all 20,210 long-term H2-receptor antagonist users was assessed as comparison. RESULTS: Pancreatic cancer was found in 1733 long-term PPI users, and 25 H2-receptor antagonist users. For PPI users, the risk of pancreatic cancer was increased overall (SIRs = 2.22; 95% CI 2.12-2.32) and in all subgroup analyses, with the highest risk among PPI-users younger than 40 years (SIR = 8.90, 95% CI 4.26-16.37), and among individuals with a history of Helicobacter pylori (SIR = 2.99, 95% CI 2.54-3.49). After the first year after enrolment (during which PPI use may be because of early symptoms of pancreatic cancer), the risk remained increased over time, with SIR = 1.57 (95% CI 1.38-1.76) after 5 years. No associations were found for H2-receptor antagonists (SIR = 1.02, 95% CI 0.66-1.51).

38388909,Co-design and evaluation of a digital serious game to promote public awareness about pancreatic cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Pancreatic cancer, ranking seventh in global cancer-related deaths, poses a significant public health challenge with increasing incidence and mortality. Most cases are diagnosed at an advanced stage, resulting in low survival rates. Early diagnosis significantly impacts prognosis, making symptom awareness crucial. Symptoms are often subtle, leading to delayed help-seeking behaviour. Patients and their carers prioritise increased public awareness, indicating a need for innovative approaches to promote awareness of the disease. METHODS: This study employed a quasi-experimental pre-test/post-test design to assess the relationship between a serious game and pancreatic cancer awareness. Members of the public (N = 727) were recruited internationally, via social media and with signposting by relevant organisations. Participants completed measures of symptom awareness and help-seeking intentions before and after playing the game. The serious game, co-designed with experts by lived experience, patient advocates and healthcare professionals, presented participants with a human anatomy diagram, with each section linked to a question about pancreatic cancer. RESULTS: The serious game demonstrated a statistically significant improvement on pancreatic cancer awareness based on matched paired t-tests. Due to missing data, paired comparisons were only possible for 489 cases. Symptom awareness scores exhibited a statistically significant increase from pre-test to post-test, with a large effect size (p < 0.001, d = 1.43). Help-seeking intentions also markedly improved, showing a significant increase from pre-test to post-test, with a large effect size (p < 0.001, d = 1.10). Independent-samples t-tests were also conducted to determine if there were any group differences on pre- to post-test changes based on age, gender, and previous knowledge and/or experience of pancreatic cancer. Participants overwhelmingly endorsed the game's usability and educational value, suggesting its potential as an effective tool for enhancing public awareness and proactive health-seeking behaviour. DISCUSSION: This study is the first to explore a serious game's utility in pancreatic cancer awareness. Results suggest that such interventions can effectively increase public awareness and influence help-seeking intentions. The co-design process ensured content relevance, and participant satisfaction was high. Findings highlight the game's potential as an accessible and convenient tool for diverse populations.",Humans; *Pancreatic Neoplasms/diagnosis; Health Personnel; Health Behavior,Anderson T; Prue G; McDowell G; Stark P; Brown Wilson C; Graham Wisener L; Kerr H; Caughers G; Rogers K; Cook L; Craig S; Alanazi A; Mitchell G,BMC public health,2024,Feb,BMC Public Health. 2024 Feb 22;24(1):570. doi: 10.1186/s12889-024-18050-7.,England,422,10885377

CASE REPORT Case 1: A 74-year-old man was diagnosed with hilar cholangiocarcinoma with celiac axis stenosis. The collateral from the superior mesenteric artery ran through the pancreas head but no invasion was observed in preoperative imaging. Hepatopancreatoduodenectomy with preservation of a collateral was performed. Case 2: A 69-year-old woman was diagnosed with pancreas head cancer with celiac axis occlusion. The collateral from the superior mesenteric artery ran through pancreas head and tumor invasion was observed. Pancreaticoduodenectomy with bypass revascularization using a vein graft was performed. Both operations were performed safely oncologically under preoperative planning that was based on computed tomographic angiography. The operative procedure was ultimately determined by evaluation of perioperative blood flow under Doppler ultrasonography after clamping the gastroduodenal artery. CONCLUSIONS Preoperative simulations of arterial revascularization and perioperative evaluation of blood flow are necessary for the success of this procedure.","Aged; *Collateral Circulation; Computed Tomography Angiography; Female; Hepatic Artery/*surgery; Humans; Liver/blood supply; Male; Median Arcuate Ligament Syndrome/diagnosis/etiology/*surgery; Mesenteric Artery, Superior/*surgery; Pancreatic Neoplasms/complications/*surgery; Pancreaticoduodenectomy/*methods; Vascular Surgical Procedures/*methods",Shibuya K; Kamachi H; Orimo T; Nagatsu A; Shimada S; Wakayama K; Yokoo H; Kamiyama T; Taketomi A,The American journal of case reports,2018,Apr,Am J Case Rep. 2018 Apr 9;19:413-420. doi: 10.12659/ajcr.908516.,United States,397,5912007
39711061,A Randomized Controlled Trial of Mindfulness Meditation Combined With BrainLink Intelligent Biofeedback Instrument on Pancreatic Cancer Patients Under Chemotherapy.,"BACKGROUND: Adjuvant chemotherapy can promote the 5-year overall survival rate of pancreatic cancer (PC) patients to 16%-21%. However, the negative emotions of patients, such as anxiety, are usually omitted. Moreover, their disease burden concentrates on pain symptoms, seriously affecting the quality of life of patients. How to improve the negative emotions of PC patients, alleviate their pain, and ameliorate their quality of life has become an urgent issue. OBJECTIVE: To explore the effect of mindfulness meditation (MM) combined with the BrainLink intelligent biofeedback instrument on the anxiety, pain, brain fatigue, and quality of life of PC patients under chemotherapy. METHOD: A total of 145 PC patients under chemotherapy were admitted to the Department of Hepatobiliary Surgery of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Army Military Medical University from January 2022 to March 2024 and were incorporated as study objects. They were divided into a control group (n = 72) and a test group (n = 73) according to the random number table. The control group received routine nursing treatment; the experimental group was treated with MM combined with an intelligent biofeedback instrument. The general information, anxiety (SAS), pain (VAS), EEG signal data (degrees of fatigue, concentration, and relaxation and EEG waves), and quality of life (EORTC QLQ-C30) of the two groups before intervention and 4th, 8th, and 12th weeks after intervention were compared. RESULT: There is no significant difference in baseline data and pathological features between the two groups. After the 4th, 8th, and 12th weeks of intervention, the SAS values of the experimental group are remarkably lower than those of the control group (p < 0.05). In the 4th, 8th, and 12th weeks of intervention, the VAS scores of the experimental group are apparently lower than those of the control group (p < 0.05). In the 4th, 8th, and 12th weeks of intervention, the score of the quality of life (EORTC QLQ-C30) in the experimental group is significantly higher than that in the control group (p < 0.05). In the 4th, 8th, and 12th weeks, compared with the control group, the experimental group patients showed significant improvement in brain fatigue relief, concentration, and relaxation levels (p < 0.05), while the experimental group's brain alpha and theta. The wave showed an upward trend (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: MM combined with the BrainLink intelligent biofeedback instrument can significantly mitigate the anxiety, pain severity, and brain fatigue relief degree of PC patients under chemotherapy, thereby promoting their quality of life. It provides a novel intervention for the psychosomatic health of PC patients under chemotherapy.","Humans; *Pancreatic Neoplasms/therapy/drug therapy; Male; *Mindfulness/methods; Female; Middle Aged; *Quality of Life; *Anxiety/therapy/etiology; *Meditation/methods; *Biofeedback, Psychology/methods; Fatigue/therapy/etiology; Adult; Aged; Chemotherapy, Adjuvant",Mi N; Zhang ST; Sun XL; Li T; Liao Y; Dong L; Chu LL,Brain and behavior,2024,Dec,Brain Behav. 2024 Dec;14(12):e70197. doi: 10.1002/brb3.70197.,United States,487,11664036
34744438,Targeting Endoglin Expressing Cells in the Tumor Microenvironment Does Not Inhibit Tumor Growth in a Pancreatic Cancer Mouse Model.,"BACKGROUND: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most lethal forms of cancer and is known to have low immunogenicity and an immunosuppressive microenvironment. It is also characterized by high accumulation of dense stroma, composed of mostly cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Multiple subsets of CAFs are described, with one of them expressing the transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta co-receptor endoglin. In previous work, we and others have shown that endoglin-expressing CAFs stimulate tumor progression and metastasis. Therefore, in this study, we set out to investigate the role of endoglin-expressing CAFs in pancreatic cancer progression. METHODS: First, we investigated the expression of endoglin on CAFs in both human tissues as well as a mouse model for PDAC. Since CAF-specific endoglin expression was high, we targeted endoglin by using the endoglin neutralizing antibody TRC105 in the murine KPC model for PDAC. RESULTS: Although some signs of immune activation were observed, TRC105 did not affect tumor growth. Since 90% of the CD8+ T-cells expressed the immune checkpoint PD-1, we investigated the combination with a PD1 checkpoint inhibitor, which did not enhance therapeutic responses. Finally, genetic deletion of endoglin from collagen 1a1 expressing cells also did not affect the growth of the mouse KPC tumors. CONCLUSION: Our results show that although endoglin is highly expressed on PDAC-CAFs and signaling is efficiently inhibited by TRC105, this does not result in decreased tumor growth in the KPC model for pancreatic cancer.",,Schoonderwoerd MJA; Hakuno SK; Sassen M; Kuhlemaijer EB; Paauwe M; Slingerland M; Fransen MF; Hawinkels LJAC,OncoTargets and therapy,2021,,Onco Targets Ther. 2021 Oct 29;14:5205-5220. doi: 10.2147/OTT.S322276. eCollection 2021.,New Zealand,349,8565992
33425718,CircRNA_000864 Upregulates B-cell Translocation Gene 2 Expression and Represses Migration and Invasion in Pancreatic Cancer Cells by Binding to miR-361-3p.,"BACKGROUND: Pancreatic cancer is a fatal disease with a very poor prognosis due to its characteristic insidious symptoms, early metastasis, and chemoresistance. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are involved in the development of pancreatic cancer. AIM: Hence, the aim of this study is to elucidate the mechanism of circRNA_000864 in regulating BTG2 expression in pancreatic cancer by binding to miR-361-3p. METHODS: CircRNA_000864, miR-361-3p, and BTG2 expression patterns in the pancreatic cancer tissues were detected by RT-qPCR. Correlation among circRNA_000864, miR-361-3p, and BTG2 was evaluated by RNA-pull down assay, RNA Immunoprecipitation assay, and dual-luciferase reporter gene assay. After ectopic expression and depletion experiments, 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine assay, Transwell assay, and flow cytometry were employed to assess the cell proliferation, migration and invasion, cell cycle, and apoptosis. Xenotransplantation of nude mice was conducted to detect the effects of circRNA_000864, miR-361-3p, and BTG2 on tumor growth. RESULTS: CircRNA_000864 and BTG2 were poorly expressed, and miR-361-3p was highly expressed in the pancreatic cancer tissues. CircRNA_000864 bound to miR-361-3p could target BTG2. Cell proliferation, migration, and invasion were inhibited, and the cell cycle arrest and apoptosis were stimulated after overexpression of circRNA_000864 or BTG2 or downregulation of miR-361-3p. Overexpression of circRNA_000864 or downregulation of miR-361-3p also decreased the tumor growth in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: Conjointly, our findings elicited that the overexpression of circRNA_000864 could promote BTG2 expression to inhibit pancreatic cancer development by binding to miR-361-3p, which represents an appealing therapeutic target for the treatment of pancreatic cancer.",,Huang L; Han J; Yu H; Liu J; Gui L; Wu Z; Zhao X; Su S; Fu G; Li F,Frontiers in oncology,2020,,Front Oncol. 2020 Dec 23;10:547942. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2020.547942. eCollection 2020.,Switzerland,405,7793745
37296977,Ablative vs. Non-Ablative Radiotherapy in Palliating Locally Advanced Pancreatic Cancer: A Single Institution Experience and a Systematic Review of the Literature.,"We studied the dose-local control (LC) relationship in ablative vs. non-ablative radiotherapy in a non-radical treatment setting of ""locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC)"" by comparing our patients (n = 89) treated with SBRT on the CyberKnife unit vs. conventional radiation between January 2005 and January 2021, and by reviewing the literature. A systematic search was performed leveraging Medline for references on SBRT use in pancreatic cancer without date terms or language restrictions. A total of 3702 references were identified and the search was then repeated in Embase and the Cochrane database. Ultimately, 12 studies were eligible for inclusion, which either compared SBRT to conventional radiation, or SBRT use in dose escalation for primary LAPC in a non-neoadjuvant setting. Our cohort's median overall survival was 152 days (CI 95%, 118-185); including 371 days (CI 95%, 230-511) vs. 126 days (CI 95%, 90-161) favoring SBRT, p = 0.004. The median time to local progression was 170 days (48-923) for SBRT vs. 107 days (27-489) for the non-ablative group. In our SBRT patients, no local progressions were seen with BED(10) > 60 Gy. Even when palliating LAPC, SBRT should be considered as an alternative to conventional radiation, especially in patients with a low disease burden. BED(10) >/= 60-70 Gy offers better local control without increasing toxicity rates. Less local progression may provide a better quality of life to those patients who already have a short life expectancy.",,Kamel R; Dennis K; Doody J; Pantarotto J,Cancers,2023,Jun,Cancers (Basel). 2023 Jun 1;15(11):3016. doi: 10.3390/cancers15113016.,Switzerland,438,10251968
33520714,Research Progress of Pancreas-Related Microorganisms and Pancreatic Cancer.,"Pancreatic cancer is one of the most common digestive system cancers. Early diagnosis is difficult owing to the lack of specific symptoms and reliable biomarkers. The cause of pancreatic cancer remains ambiguous. Smoking, drinking, new-onset diabetes, and chronic pancreatitis have been proven to be associated with the occurrence of pancreatic cancer. In recent years, a large number of studies have clarified that a variety of microorganisms colonized in pancreatic cancer tissues are also closely related to the occurrence and development of pancreatic cancer, and the specific mechanisms include inflammatory induction, immune regulation, metabolism, and microenvironment changes caused by microorganism. The mechanism of action of the pancreatic colonized microbiome in the tumor microenvironment, as well as immunotherapy approaches require further study in order to find more evidence to explain the complex relationship between the pancreatic colonized microbiome and PDAC. Relevant studies targeting the microbiome may provide insight into the mechanisms of PDAC development and progression, improving treatment effectiveness and overall patient prognosis. In this article, we focus on the research relating to the microorganisms colonized in pancreatic cancer tissues, including viruses, bacteria, and fungi. We also highlight the microbial diversity in the occurrence, invasion, metastasis, treatment, and prognosis of pancreatic cancer in order to elucidate its significance in the early diagnosis and new therapeutic treatment of pancreatic cancer, which urgently need to be improved in clinical practice. The elimination or increase in diversity of the pancreatic microbiome is beneficial for prolonging the survival of PDAC patients, improving the response to chemotherapy drugs, and reducing tumor burden. The colonization of microorganisms in the pancreas may become a new hotspot in the diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic cancer.",,Zhang W; Zhang K; Zhang P; Zheng J; Min C; Li X,Frontiers in oncology,2020,,Front Oncol. 2021 Jan 14;10:604531. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2020.604531. eCollection 2020.,Switzerland,447,7841623
34213428,The role of EUS in diagnosing focal autoimmune pancreatitis and differentiating it from pancreatic cancer.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The clinical presentation of focal autoimmune pancreatitis (FAIP) and together with radiological overlap can mimic pancreatic cancer (PC). The aim of this study is to construct and validate a prediction model for differentiating FAIP from PC according to EUS characteristics. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ninety patients with FAIP and 196 patients with PC, who consecutively underwent EUS at our center from January 2013 to December 2018, were retrospectively included in the study. The enrolled patients were randomly divided into either a derivation sample or a validation sample. According to EUS characteristics, multivariate stepwise logistic regression and receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analyses were used to construct a prediction model in derivation sample, and then, the efficacy was assessed in validation sample. RESULTS: EUS characteristics that were suggestive of FAIP included diffuse hypoechogenicity, hyperechoic foci/stands or lobularity (parenchymal heterogeneity), bile duct wall thickening and peripancreatic hypoechoic margin; and EUS features favoring PC included focal hypoechogenicity, absence of parenchymal heterogeneity, pancreatic duct dilation, and vessel involvement. The prediction model, with an area under the ROC curve of more than 0.95, had a good capability to distinguish FAIP from PC. By using the optimal cutoff value, the efficacy of model for diagnosing PC showed 83.7%-91.8% sensitivity and 93.3%-95.6% specificity. CONCLUSIONS: It is feasible to differentiate FAIP from PC based on EUS characteristics. The prediction model built in this study needs to be further confirmed by multicenter prospective researches.",,Guo T; Xu T; Zhang S; Lai Y; Wu X; Wu D; Feng Y; Jiang Q; Wang Q; Qian J; Yang A,Endoscopic ultrasound,2021,Jul-Aug,Endosc Ultrasound. 2021 Jul-Aug;10(4):280-287. doi: 10.4103/EUS-D-20-00212.,China,295,8411560
23314652,Development and preliminary validation of the pancreatic cancer disease impact score.,"OBJECTIVE: Patient-reported outcomes are important for clinical practice and research, and should reflect what patients perceive as important. The objective of this study was to develop and preliminarily validate a brief, patient-derived, disease-specific tool, the pancreatic cancer disease impact (PACADI) score. METHODS: The development was performed in two phases. Forty-one patients with confirmed pancreatic cancer (PC) selected dimensions of health related to the impact of the disease. A weighting of the eight most frequently reported dimensions was performed in a second sample of 80 PC patients who also rated the impact on eight numeric rating scales (NRS, range 0 to 10). The relative weights and the scores from the NRS were used to compute the PACADI score (range 0 to 10). The patients also completed Edmonton Symptom Assessment System (ESAS) and EQ-5D. RESULTS: Dimensions reported by more than 20% of the patients were included in the PACADI score (relative weights in parenthesis): pain/discomfort (0.16), fatigue (0.16), anxiety (0.15), bowel/digestive problems (0.14), loss of appetite (0.13), dry mouth (0.11), itchiness (0.08), and nausea (0.07). The PACADI score in the 80 PC patients had a mean (SD) value of 3.26 (2.06) (95% CI 2.80, 3.71), was moderately to strongly correlated to ESAS sense of well-being (r = 0.69) and EQ-5D (r = -0.52), and discriminated significantly between patients with and without PC. CONCLUSION: The PACADI score is a new eight-item, patient-derived, disease-specific measure. Preliminary validation regarding construct validity and discrimination encourages further validation in independent patient samples.","Aged; Anxiety/etiology/psychology; Arthritis, Rheumatoid/complications/physiopathology/psychology; Cost of Illness; Cross-Sectional Studies; Fatigue/*etiology/physiopathology/psychology; Female; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Middle Aged; Nausea/*etiology/physiopathology/psychology; Pain/*etiology/physiopathology/psychology; Pain Measurement; Pancreatic Neoplasms/*complications/physiopathology/psychology; Psychometrics/standards; Quality of Life; Self Report/*standards; *Severity of Illness Index; Surveys and Questionnaires/standards",Heiberg T; Nordby T; Kvien TK; Buanes T,Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,2013,Jun,Support Care Cancer. 2013 Jun;21(6):1677-84. doi: 10.1007/s00520-012-1713-3.

34163103,Pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer: A case of the chicken or the egg.,"Acute pancreatitis (AP), chronic pancreatitis (CP) and pancreatic cancer are three distinct pancreatic diseases with different prognoses and treatment options. However, it may be difficult to differentiate between benign and malignant disease. AP may be a first symptom of pancreatic cancer, particularly in patients between the ages of 56 and 75 with presumed idiopathic AP who had a concomitant diagnosis of new-onset diabetes mellitus or patients who present with CP at diagnosis of AP. In these patients, additional imaging is warranted, preferably by endoscopic ultrasonography. CP may lead to pancreatic cancer through oncogenic mutations, mostly in patients with hereditary CP, and in patients in whom risk factors for pancreatic cancer (e.g., nicotine and alcohol abuse) are also present. Patients with PRSS1-mediated CP and patients with a history of autosomal dominant hereditary CP without known genetic mutations may be considered for surveillance for pancreatic cancer. Pancreatic inflammation may mimic pancreatic cancer by appearing as a focal mass-forming lesion on imaging. Differentiation between the above mentioned benign and malignant disease may be facilitated by specific features like the duct-penetrating sign and the duct-to-parenchyma ratio. Research efforts are aimed towards developing a superior discriminant between pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer in the form of imaging modalities or biomarkers. This may aid clinicians in timely diagnosing pancreatic cancer in a potentially curable stage.","Acute Disease; Aged; Humans; Middle Aged; *Pancreatic Diseases; *Pancreatic Neoplasms/diagnostic imaging; *Pancreatitis, Chronic/diagnostic imaging/therapy",Umans DS; Hoogenboom SA; Sissingh NJ; Lekkerkerker SJ; Verdonk RC; van Hooft JE,World journal of gastroenterology,2021,Jun,World J Gastroenterol. 2021 Jun 21;27(23):3148-3157. doi: 10.3748/wjg.v27.i23.3148.,United States,427,8218365
31068222,The efficacy and safety of modified FOLFIRINOX as first-line chemotherapy for Chinese patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Oxaliplatin, irinotecan, 5-fluorouracil, and L-leucovorin (FOLFIRINOX) has become one of the first-line treatment options for advanced pancreatic cancer (PC). However, the relatively high rate of grade 3 or 4 adverse events associated with the standard dosage of FOLFIRINOX limits its widespread use in clinical practice. In this study, we were to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a modified FOLFIRINOX regimen as a first-line chemotherapy for Chinese patients with metastatic PC. METHODS: Patients with histologically confirmed primary metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score of 0-2 were recruited to receive the modified FOLFIRINOX regimen (intravenous infusion of oxaliplatin, 65 mg/m(2); irinotecan, 150 mg/m(2); L-leucovorin, 200 mg/m(2); and 5-fluorouracil, 2400 mg/m(2), repeated every 2 weeks). The treatment was continued for 12 cycles unless the patient had progressive disease (PD), stable disease (SD) with symptom deterioration, unacceptable adverse events, or requested to terminate the treatment prematurely. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR). RESULTS: Sixty-five patients were enrolled from July 2012 to April 2017 in three institutions, and they all received at least one cycle of chemotherapy, with a median of 8 cycles (range 1-12 cycles). No complete response was observed. Twenty-one (32.3%) patients had partial responses, and 27 (41.5%) had SD. The ORR and disease control rate of the study cohort was 32.3% and 73.8%. The estimated median overall survival and progression-free survival were 11.60 (95% confidence interval [CI] 8.76-14.44) and 5.77 (95% CI 5.00-6.54) months. Major grade 3 or 4 adverse events included neutropenia (12.3%) and diarrhea (6.2%). No treatment-related death was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Modified FOLFIRINOX was well-tolerated and might be a promising option as first-line therapy for Chinese patients with metastatic PC. Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02028806.

39001465,Improved Pancreatic Cancer Detection and Localization on CT Scans: A Computer-Aided Detection Model Utilizing Secondary Features.,"The early detection of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is essential for optimal treatment of pancreatic cancer patients. We propose a tumor detection framework to improve the detection of pancreatic head tumors on CT scans. In this retrospective research study, CT images of 99 patients with pancreatic head cancer and 98 control cases from the Catharina Hospital Eindhoven were collected. A multi-stage 3D U-Net-based approach was used for PDAC detection including clinically significant secondary features such as pancreatic duct and common bile duct dilation. The developed algorithm was evaluated using a local test set comprising 59 CT scans. The model was externally validated in 28 pancreatic cancer cases of a publicly available medical decathlon dataset. The tumor detection framework achieved a sensitivity of 0.97 and a specificity of 1.00, with an area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) of 0.99, in detecting pancreatic head cancer in the local test set. In the external test set, we obtained similar results, with a sensitivity of 1.00. The model provided the tumor location with acceptable accuracy obtaining a DICE Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 0.37. This study shows that a tumor detection framework utilizing CT scans and secondary signs of pancreatic cancer can detect pancreatic tumors with high accuracy.",,Ramaekers M; Viviers CGA; Hellstrom TAE; Ewals LJS; Tasios N; Jacobs I; Nederend J; Sommen FV; Luyer MDP,Cancers,2024,Jun,Cancers (Basel). 2024 Jun 29;16(13):2403. doi: 10.3390/cancers16132403.,Switzerland,464,11240790
36292420,Prediction Model of the Quality of Life for Patients with Pancreatic Cancer.,"This study attempted to establish a predictive model that systematically and comprehensively predicts the quality of life (QoL) of patients with pancreatic cancer. The study used a descriptive cross-sectional design. A total of 248 patients was included who were selected via the convenience sampling method. A structured questionnaire was used and the collected data were analyzed for fitness, using the SPSS WIN 25.0 program and AMOS 24.0. The perceived health status of the patients with pancreatic cancer would directly affect their QoL and indirectly influence the QoL through social support, symptoms, functional status, and age. The application of social support intervention programs to relieve specific symptoms and improve the functional status according to the conditions of patients may contribute to improving the QoL of pancreatic cancer patients. This predictive model could be used as the basis for developing a nursing intervention plan and writing evaluation guidelines for practitioners who provide nursing care for patients with pancreatic cancer.",,Lee J,"Healthcare (Basel, Switzerland)",2022,Oct,Healthcare (Basel). 2022 Oct 9;10(10):1973. doi: 10.3390/healthcare10101973.,Switzerland,275,9602008
36092954,Integration of Specialized Palliative Care with Oncological Treatment in Patients with Advanced Pancreatic Cancer.,"INTRODUCTION: The incidence of pancreatic cancer is around 5 in 100,000, and the 5-year survival is poor. Pancreatic cancer patients have a high disease-specific burden of symptoms, and palliative chemotherapy has varying side effects. The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) suggests integrating specialized palliative care (SPC) with standard oncological treatment for pancreatic cancer patients at stage >/=III. This study investigated the effects of enrollment into SPC >30 days before death. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study included 170 patients with histopathologically verified pancreatic adenocarcinoma who received palliative chemotherapy at Skane University Hospital and died between February 1, 2015, and December 31, 2017. RESULTS: Of the 170 patients, 151 were enrolled within the SPC unit; 97 of them for >30 days before death (group A). The remainder (group B) received SPC for </=30 days before death (n = 54) or not at all (n = 19). Patients in groups A and B lived a median of 73 and 44 days, respectively, after the last palliative chemotherapy treatment (p < 0.001), but did not differ in terms of median overall survival (11.2 months vs. 10.9 months). Death in the hospital occurred in 84% of patients never admitted to SPC and 2% of patients ever admitted to SPC. CONCLUSION: Enrollment in SPC for longer than 30 days may lower the risk of receiving futile palliative chemotherapy at the end of life, compared with patients enrolled in SPC for 30 days or less before death. Enrollment in SPC lowers the risk of dying in a hospital.",,Ekstrom A; Brun E; Eberhard J; Segerlantz M,Journal of pancreatic cancer,2022,Aug,J Pancreat Cancer. 2022 Aug 12;8(1):2-8. doi: 10.1089/pancan.2022.0004. eCollection 2022 Aug.,United States,324,9451139
40199771,"Navigating pain and appetite challenges in palliative care for pancreatic cancer: insights from a national, longitudinal consecutive cohort study.","PURPOSE: Pancreatic cancer poses significant challenges in symptom management. Many people have intractable pain and anorexia which is often not amenable to current available options for palliation. This study aims to outline the longitudinal patterns and assess the burden of distress related to pain and appetite experienced by individuals with pancreatic cancer in people referred to Australian palliative care services. METHODS: Consecutive national cohort study using point-of-care data on symptom distress in people referred to specialist palliative care services. RESULTS: From 2013 to 2022, information from 20,558 care episodes involving 15,536 people with pancreatic cancer referred to 203 palliative care services nationally were included. Similar numbers of people were admitted to inpatient and community services, with 69% and 60% reporting distress due to pain and appetite, respectively. Distress extended to sleeping (79%, 82%), nausea (83%, 85%), bowels (80%, 83%), breathing (70%, 77%) and fatigue (77%, 77%) for pain and appetite, respectively. Strongest associations were with psychological/spiritual issues (inpatient OR 1.78, 95% CI 1.66-1.90) and pain severity (community OR 1.51, 95% CI 1.42-1.60) for appetite-related distress and pain severity (inpatient OR 1.60, 95% CI 1.49-1.72; community OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.27-1.44) for pain distress. Trends within the cohort revealed increased mild appetite-related distress (+ 10%) and decreased moderate (- 22%) and severe (- 11%) distress, with similar trends for pain. CONCLUSION: This study underscores prevalent distress in people with pancreatic cancer in Australian palliative care, highlighting the need for optimised referrals and strategies targeting pain severity, appetite-related concerns and psychological and spiritual aspects for improved care outcomes.","Humans; *Pancreatic Neoplasms/psychology/therapy/complications; *Palliative Care/methods; Female; Male; Aged; Middle Aged; Appetite; Australia/epidemiology; Longitudinal Studies; Aged, 80 and over; Cohort Studies; Adult; *Anorexia/etiology; *Cancer Pain/psychology/therapy/etiology",Sousa MS; Garcia MV; Blanchard M; Daveson B; Currow D; Khan NN; Goldstein D; Findlay M; Landers A; Agar MR,Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,2025,Apr,Support Care Cancer. 2025 Apr 8;33(5):365. doi: 10.1007/s00520-025-09402-z.,Germany,495,11978711

40418805,Understanding the Experiences of Patients With Pancreatic Cancer: Quantitative Analysis of the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network Patient Registry.,"BACKGROUND: The Pancreatic Cancer Action Network (PanCAN) established its Patient Registry to gather real-world data from patients with pancreatic cancer and their caregivers, related to their diagnosis, symptoms and symptom management, treatments, and more. Results from version 2 of the PanCAN Registry are presented here. OBJECTIVE: We sought to gather and evaluate patient-reported outcomes data inputted into the PanCAN Patient Registry from December 2020 to January 2024. Statistical analyses were used to identify findings from a relatively small sample size (271 participants, as defined by people who filled out the Basics survey of the PanCAN Registry). METHODS: Participation in the PanCAN Patient Registry was voluntary, and participants filled out an electronic consent form before joining the registry. Participants were identified through the PanCAN Patient Services Help Line or navigated to the registry directly via the PanCAN website. Data analysis took place via bivariate analysis using the chi-square test for categorical variables. Statistical significance was defined as a P value of <.05, with P values between .05 and .1 considered marginally significant, and P values >.1 considered insignificant. RESULTS: Pain was reported by 186 out of the 207 (89.9%) PanCAN Patient Registry participants who filled out the pain-related questions in the General Assessment survey. We observed a marginally significant (P=.06) difference between the reporting of pain by patients aged younger than 65 years (86/92, 93.5%) and those aged 65 years or older (66/78, 84.6%). Depression was also a common condition experienced by patients with pancreatic cancer, with 64/103 (62.1%) indicating that they were experiencing or had experienced depression during the course of their illness. A trend suggested that depression was more frequently reported among the subset of patients who also reported pain (53/80, 66.3%) compared with those who did not report pain (5/13, 38.5%; P=.07). CONCLUSIONS: The use of patient-reported outcomes and real-world data for patients with pancreatic cancer has the potential to have direct impact on clinical practice. Through a relatively small sampling of patients, trends were identified that suggest a higher reporting of pain amongst patients in a younger age group as well as concurrence of pain and depression. These findings underscore the importance of a multidisciplinary team of health care professionals addressing patients' needs beyond the treatment of their cancer.",,Rosenzweig A; Rathjens S; Abdilleh K; Ladnier D; Zelada-Arenas F; Doss S; Matrisian LM,Journal of participatory medicine,2025,May,J Particip Med. 2025 May 26;17:e65046. doi: 10.2196/65046.,Canada,438,12149456
31357636,Postoperative Imaging and Tumor Marker Surveillance in Resected Pancreatic Cancer.,"Background: Pancreatic cancer is a catastrophic disease with high recurrence and death rates, even in early stages. Early detection and early treatment improve survival in many cancer types but have not yet been clearly documented to do so in pancreatic cancer. In this study, we assessed the benefit on survival resulting from different patterns of surveillance in daily practice after curative surgery of early pancreatic cancer. Methods: Patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma who had received curative surgery between January 2000 and December 2013 at our institute were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were classified into one of four groups, based on surveillance strategy: the symptom group, the imaging group, the marker group (carbohydrate antigen 19-9 and/or carcinoembryonic antigen), and the intense group (both imaging and tumor marker assessment). Overall survival (OS), relapse-free survival (RFS), and post-recurrence overall survival (PROS) were evaluated. Results: One hundred and eighty-one patients with documented recurrence or metastasis were included in our analysis. The median OS for patients in the symptom group, imaging group, marker group, and intense group were 21.4 months, 13.9 months, 20.5 months, and 16.5 months, respectively (p = 0.670). Surveillance with imaging, tumor markers, or both was not an independent risk factor for OS in univariate and multivariate analyses. There was no significant difference in median RFS (symptom group, 11.7 months; imaging group, 6.3 months; marker group, 9.3 months; intense group, 6.9 months; p = 0.259) or median PROS (symptom group, 6.9 months; imaging group, 7.5 months; marker group, 5.0 months; intense group, 7.8 months; p = 0.953) between the four groups. Multivariate analyses identified poor Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS) (>/=1), primary tumor site (tail), and tumor grade (poor differentiation) were poor prognostic factors for OS. Conclusions: Surveillance with regular imaging, tumor marker, or both was not an independent risk factor for OS of pancreatic cancer patients who undergo curative tumor resection.",,Wu H; Guo JC; Yang SH; Tien YW; Kuo SH,Journal of clinical medicine,2019,Jul,J Clin Med. 2019 Jul 27;8(8):1115. doi: 10.3390/jcm8081115.,Switzerland,378,6722558
39431298,Establishment of a Prognostic Model for Pancreatic Cancer Based on Hypoxia-Related Genes.,"OBJECTIVES: Pancreatic cancer presents a formidable challenge with its aggressive nature and dismal prognosis, often hampered by elusive early symptoms. The tumor microenvironment (TME) emerges as a pivotal player in pancreatic cancer progression and treatment responses, characterized notably by hypoxia and immunosuppression. In this study, we aimed to identify hypoxia-related genes and develop a prognostic model for pancreatic cancer leveraging these genes. METHODS: Through analysis of gene expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and subsequent GO/KEGG enrichment analysis, hypoxia-related pathways were identified. We constructed a prognostic model using lasso regression and validated it using an independent dataset. RESULTS: Our results showed that expression levels of PLAU, SLC2A1, and CA9 exhibited significant associations with prognosis in pancreatic cancer. The prognostic model, built upon these genes, displayed robust predictive accuracy and was validated in an independent dataset. Furthermore, we found a correlation between the risk score of the prognostic model and clinical parameters of pancreatic cancer patients. At the same time, we also explored the relationship between the established hypoxia-related prognostic model and the immune microenvironment at the single-cell level. RT-qPCR results showed notable differences in the expression of hypoxia pathway-related genes between normal PANC-1 and hypoxic-treated PANC-1 cells. CONCLUSION: Our study provides insights into the role of the hypoxic microenvironment in pancreatic cancer and offers a promising prognostic tool for clinical application.","*Pancreatic Neoplasms/genetics/pathology/mortality; Humans; Prognosis; *Tumor Microenvironment/genetics; *Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; *Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics; Gene Expression Profiling; Carbonic Anhydrase IX/genetics/metabolism; Glucose Transporter Type 1/genetics/metabolism; Computational Biology/methods; Antigens, Neoplasm/genetics; Databases, Genetic; Hypoxia/genetics; Cell Line, Tumor; Transcriptome",Wu Y; Zhou J; Kou Q; Sun L; Ma Y; Yang T; Hu X,Technology in cancer research & treatment,2024,Jan-Dec,Technol Cancer Res Treat. 2024 Jan-Dec;23:15330338241288687. doi: 10.1177/15330338241288687.,United States,294,11504279
36092340,The efficacy and safety of gemcitabine-based combination therapy vs. gemcitabine alone for the treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Gemcitabine (GEM) is used as a standard first-line drug to effectively alleviate symptoms and prolong survival time for advanced pancreatic cancer. Most randomized controlled trials (RCTs) show that GEM-based combination therapy is better than GEM alone, while some RCTs have the opposite conclusion. This study aimed to investigate whether GEM-based combination therapy would be superior to GEM alone by a systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: According to the PICOS principles, RCTs (S) focused on comparing GEM-based combination therapy (I) vs. GEM alone (C) for advanced pancreatic cancer (P) were collected from eight electronic databases, outcome variables mainly include survival status and adverse events (AEs) (O). Review Manager 5.4 was used to evaluate the pooled effects of the results among selected articles. Pooled estimate of hazard ratio (HR) and odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) were used as measures of effect sizes. Quality assessment for individual study was performed using the Cochrane tool for risk of bias. RESULTS: A total of 17 studies including 5,197 patients were selected in this analysis. The pooled results revealed that GEM-based combination therapy significantly improved the overall survival (OS; HR =0.84; 95% CI: 0.79 to 0.90; P<0.00001), progression-free survival (PFS; HR =0.78; 95% CI: 0.72 to 0.84; P<0.00001), overall response rate (ORR; OR =1.92; 95% CI: 1.61 to 2.30; P<0.00001), 1-year survival rate (OR =1.44; 95% CI: 1.02 to 2.03; P=0.04), respectively. Subgroup analysis showed that the efficacy of GEM plus capecitabine (CAP) and GEM plus S-1 was better than that of GEM alone, while GEM plus cisplatin (CIS) did not achieve an improved effect. GEM-based combination therapy can significantly increase the incidence of AEs, such as leukopenia (P<0.001), neutropenia (P<0.001), anemia (P<0.05), nausea (P<0.001), diarrhea (P<0.05), and stomatitis (P<0.001). No publication bias existed in our meta-analysis (P>0.10). DISCUSSION: Our study supported that GEM-based combination therapy was more beneficial to improve patient's survival than GEM alone, while there was no additional benefits in GEM plus CIS. We also found that GEM-based combination therapy increased the incidence of AEs.

37046830,The Cell Biology of Metastatic Invasion in Pancreatic Cancer: Updates and Mechanistic Insights.,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality worldwide. This is largely due to the lack of routine screening protocols, an absence of symptoms in early-stage disease leading to late detection, and a paucity of effective treatment options. Critically, the majority of patients either present with metastatic disease or rapidly develop metastatic disease. Thus, there is an urgent need to deepen our understanding of metastasis in PDAC. During metastasis, tumor cells escape from the primary tumor, enter the circulation, and travel to a distant site to form a secondary tumor. In order to accomplish this relatively rare event, tumor cells develop an enhanced ability to detach from the primary tumor, migrate into the surrounding matrix, and invade across the basement membrane. In addition, cancer cells interact with the various cell types and matrix proteins that comprise the tumor microenvironment, with some of these factors working to promote metastasis and others working to suppress it. In PDAC, many of these processes are not well understood. The purpose of this review is to highlight recent advances in the cell biology of the early steps of the metastatic cascade in pancreatic cancer. Specifically, we will examine the regulation of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in PDAC and its requirement for metastasis, summarize our understanding of how PDAC cells invade and degrade the surrounding matrix, and discuss how migration and adhesion dynamics are regulated in PDAC to optimize cancer cell motility. In addition, the role of the tumor microenvironment in PDAC will also be discussed for each of these invasive processes.",,Joshi VB; Gutierrez Ruiz OL; Razidlo GL,Cancers,2023,Apr,Cancers (Basel). 2023 Apr 6;15(7):2169. doi: 10.3390/cancers15072169.,Switzerland,604,10093482
28272344,Nutritional and Metabolic Derangements in Pancreatic Cancer and Pancreatic Resection.,"Pancreatic cancer is an aggressive malignancy with a poor prognosis. The disease and its treatment can cause significant nutritional impairments that often adversely impact patient quality of life (QOL). The pancreas has both exocrine and endocrine functions and, in the setting of cancer, both systems may be affected. Pancreatic exocrine insufficiency (PEI) manifests as weight loss and steatorrhea, while endocrine insufficiency may result in diabetes mellitus. Surgical resection, a central component of pancreatic cancer treatment, may induce or exacerbate these dysfunctions. Nutritional and metabolic dysfunctions in patients with pancreatic cancer lack characterization, and few guidelines exist for nutritional support in patients after surgical resection. We reviewed publications from the past two decades (1995-2016) addressing the nutritional and metabolic status of patients with pancreatic cancer, grouping them into status at the time of diagnosis, status at the time of resection, and status of nutritional support throughout the diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic cancer. Here, we summarize the results of these investigations and evaluate the effectiveness of various types of nutritional support in patients after pancreatectomy for pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC). We outline the following conservative perioperative strategies to optimize patient outcomes and guide the care of these patients: (1) patients with albumin < 2.5 mg/dL or weight loss > 10% should postpone surgery and begin aggressive nutrition supplementation; (2) patients with albumin < 3 mg/dL or weight loss between 5% and 10% should have nutrition supplementation prior to surgery; (3) enteral nutrition (EN) should be preferred as a nutritional intervention over total parenteral nutrition (TPN) postoperatively; and, (4) a multidisciplinary approach should be used to allow for early detection of symptoms of endocrine and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency alongside implementation of appropriate treatment to improve the patient's quality of life.","Biomarkers/blood/urine; Databases, Factual; Humans; Malnutrition/complications; Metabolic Diseases/metabolism/*physiopathology/therapy; Non-Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Nutritional Status; *Nutritional Support; Pancreas/surgery; Pancreatic Neoplasms/metabolism/*physiopathology/therapy; Quality of Life; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic",Gilliland TM; Villafane-Ferriol N; Shah KP; Shah RM; Tran Cao HS; Massarweh NN; Silberfein EJ; Choi EA; Hsu C; McElhany AL; Barakat O; Fisher W; Van Buren G,Nutrients,2017,Mar,Nutrients. 2017 Mar 7;9(3):243. doi: 10.3390/nu9030243.,Switzerland,1002,5372906
31784503,Metachronous Pancreatic Metastasis from Rectal Cancer that Masqueraded as a Primary Pancreatic Cancer: A Rare and Difficult-to-Diagnose Metastatic Tumor in the Pancreas.,"BACKGROUND Pancreatic metastasis from colorectal cancer is rare and can masquerade as primary pancreatic cancer. CASE REPORT A 70-year-old male was diagnosed with advanced rectal cancer with multiple liver metastases. After neoadjuvant chemotherapy, he underwent radical surgery for the primary tumor and hepatectomy for multiple liver metastases. Adjuvant chemotherapies and additional surgeries were subsequently required for recurrences in the liver, lung, and lymph nodes. A diffuse hypovascular nodule in the pancreatic head and a solitary liver metastasis were detected 2.5 years after the initial surgery and he accordingly underwent further chemotherapy. However, the pancreatic tumor progressed, invading the pancreatic duct and biliary tract. Obstructive jaundice finally prompted discontinuation of chemotherapy and he underwent biliary drainage. His diffuse and hypovascular tumor was clinically and radiographically diagnosed as a primary pancreatic cancer. Pancreatic resection for the pancreatic tumor and hepatectomy for the liver metastasis were performed 4.2 years after the initial surgery, achieving radiographic and surgical curative resection. Pathological examination of the surgical specimen resulted in a definitive diagnosis of metachronous pancreatic metastasis from his primary rectal cancer. Despite further chemotherapy, his general condition worsened; however, he remains alive 5.4 years after the initial surgery, with best supportive care. CONCLUSIONS Pancreatic metastasis originating from rectal cancer can masquerade as primary pancreatic cancer clinically and radiologically. Multimodality treatment is mandatory for metastatic colorectal cancer. Aggressive surgeries for pancreatic metastasis should be considered if curative resection appears possible radiographically and/or intraoperatively.","Aged; Chemotherapy, Adjuvant; Combined Modality Therapy; Diagnosis, Differential; Hepatectomy; Humans; Liver Neoplasms/diagnostic imaging/*secondary/*therapy; Male; Pancreatectomy; Pancreatic Neoplasms/diagnostic imaging/*secondary/*therapy; Rectal Neoplasms/diagnostic imaging/pathology/*therapy",Tani R; Hori T; Yamada M; Yamamoto H; Harada H; Yamamoto M; Yazawa T; Tani M; Kamada Y; Aoyama R; Sasaki Y; Zaima M,The American journal of case reports,2019,Nov,Am J Case Rep. 2019 Nov 30;20:1781-1787. doi: 10.12659/AJCR.918669.,United States,331,6910167
38994295,Early detection of pancreatic cancer in patients with recurrent pancreatitis: A case report.,"BACKGROUND: Pancreatic cancer presents a challenge with its low early diagnosis and treatment rates, leading to high metastasis and mortality rates. The median survival time for advanced pancreatic cancer is a mere 3 months. However, there's hope: small pancreatic cancers diagnosed at an early stage (T1) or those less than or equal to 1 cm in diameter boast an impressive 5-year survival rate of nearly 100%. This underscores the critical importance of early pancreatic cancer detection for significantly improving prognosis. CASE SUMMARY: Pancreatic cancer, a malignant tumor of the digestive tract, poses challenges in both diagnosis and treatment due to its occult and atypical clinical symptoms. Clinically, patients with recurrent pancreatitis should be vigilant, as it may be indicative of pancreatic cancer, particularly in middle-aged and elderly patients. Here, we presented the case of a patient who experienced recurrent acute pancreatitis within a span of 2 months. During the initial episode of pancreatitis, routine imaging failed to identify the cause of pancreatic cancer. However, upon recurrence of acute pancreatitis, endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) revealed a space-occupying lesion approximately 1 cm in size in the pancreatic body. Subsequent EUS coupled with fine-needle aspiration examination demonstrated atypical pancreatic gland epithelium. Ultimately, the patient underwent surgery and was diagnosed with an intraductal papillary mucinous tumor of the pancreas (severe epithelial dysplasia, focal cancer). CONCLUSION: We recommend EUS for patients with recurrent pancreatitis of unknown etiology to exclude early pancreatic cancer.",,Wei C; Li YC; Jin HT; Li DF; Wang LS; Yao J,World journal of clinical cases,2024,Jul,World J Clin Cases. 2024 Jul 6;12(19):3936-3941. doi: 10.12998/wjcc.v12.i19.3936.,United States,301,11235423
29662668,Proteomic biomarkers in body fluids associated with pancreatic cancer.,"Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a highly malignant disease that represents the fourth leading cancer-related death worldwide. There has been very little improvement in survival rates over recent years, and surgical resection remains the only reliable curative approach. Factors that contribute to this dismal prognosis for PC include its rapid progression and invasion, the absence of specific symptoms, and the little impact of available chemotherapy. Importantly, the management of this malignancy is also limited by the lack of highly specific and sensitive biomarkers for its diagnosis and follow-up, and their identification is therefore considered a promising strategy to improve outcomes in these patients. Numerous translational studies have explored the usefulness of body fluids as a non-invasive source of PC-specific biomarkers, and innovations in proteomic methods and technologies have provided a myriad of protein biomarkers for different cancers. The adoption of a proteomic approach has improved understanding of the biology of PC and contributed to the potential identification of protein biomarkers for this disease. This review considers the most recent research efforts to develop novel proteomic biomarkers in body fluids for PC.",,Jimenez-Luna C; Torres C; Ortiz R; Dieguez C; Martinez-Galan J; Melguizo C; Prados JC; Caba O,Oncotarget,2018,Mar,Oncotarget. 2018 Mar 27;9(23):16573-16587. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.24654. eCollection 2018 Mar 27.,United States,427,5893263
38384305,Gut resistome profiling reveals high diversity and fluctuations in pancreatic cancer cohorts.,"BACKGROUND: Pancreatic cancer is one of the deadliest cancer, with a 5-year overall survival rate of 11%. Unfortunately, most patients are diagnosed with advanced stage by the time they present with symptoms. In the past decade, microbiome studies have explored the association of pancreatic cancer with the human oral and gut microbiomes. However, the gut microbial antibiotic resistance genes profiling of pancreatic cancer patients was never reported compared to that of the healthy cohort. RESULTS: In this study, we addressed the gut microbial antibiotic resistance genes profile using the metagenomic data from two online public pancreatic cancer cohorts. We found a high degree of data concordance between the two cohorts, which can therefore be used for cross-sectional comparisons. Meanwhile, we used two strategies to predict antibiotic resistance genes and compared the advantages and disadvantages of these two approaches. We also constructed microbe-antibiotic resistance gene networks and found that most of the hub nodes in the networks were antibiotic resistance genes. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, we describe the panorama of antibiotic resistance genes in the gut microbes of patients with pancreatic cancer. We hope that our study will provide new perspectives on treatment options for the disease.","Humans; Cross-Sectional Studies; Anti-Bacterial Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use; Drug Resistance, Microbial; *Microbiota/genetics; *Pancreatic Neoplasms/genetics; Metagenomics",Liu X; Li K; Yang Y; Cao D; Xu X; He Z; Wu W,Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,2024,,Front Cell Infect Microbiol. 2024 Feb 7;14:1354234. doi: 10.3389/fcimb.2024.1354234. eCollection 2024.,Switzerland,380,10879602
40376004,Case Report: Combined PD-1 and tyrosine kinase blockade stabilizes refractory pancreatic cancer guided by the spatial structure of tumor immune microenvironment.,"Pancreatic cancer is characterized by a poor prognosis and limited responsiveness to conventional therapies, presenting a substantial therapeutic challenge. Although chemotherapy remains the cornerstone of systemic treatment, options become scarce once frontline therapies fail. While targeted therapies and immunotherapies have emerged as potential alternatives, their efficacy in pancreatic cancer is not well established. As research advances, exploring the tumor immune microenvironment (TiME) of pancreatic cancer is crucial and holds significant potential for developing novel treatment strategies.We report a case of a pancreatic cancer patient who, after the failure of frontline and second-line treatments, was treated with a pioneering combination of targeted therapy and immunotherapy to modulate the unique TiME. The targeted agent, surufatinib, is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that targets vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) 1-3, fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1), and colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF-1R). The immunotherapy agent, toripalimab, is an immune checkpoint inhibitor targeting programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1). Remarkably, the patient benefitted from this regimen, exhibiting stable disease, improved clinical symptoms, and prolonged progression-free survival. This case highlights the potential of personalized therapy in treating pancreatic cancer, particularly in patients with distinctive features of the TiME that may predict favorable responses to immunotherapy. Personalized strategies that consider the spatial structure and composition of the TiME may offer a promising avenue for achieving long-term progression-free survival in patients with pancreatic cancer.","Male; *Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacology/therapeutic use; Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors/pharmacology/therapeutic use; Immunotherapy; *Pancreatic Neoplasms/drug therapy/immunology/pathology; *Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor/antagonists & inhibitors; *Tumor Microenvironment/immunology/drug effects; Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology/therapeutic use; Indoles; Pyrimidines; Sulfonamides; Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized",Yang H; Ma Y; Zhang C; Leng Q; Cheng K; Zhao C; Cao D,Frontiers in immunology,2025,,Front Immunol. 2025 May 1;16:1547388. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2025.1547388. eCollection 2025.,Switzerland,283,12078320
38476780,Role of Endoscopic Ultrasound in Staging and Vascular Assessment of Pancreatic Cancer.,"Introduction Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen with contrast stands as the gold standard for assessing pancreatic cancer, encompassing both staging and vascular analysis. However, not all patients are suitable candidates for contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) scans due to factors such as contrast agent allergies, pregnancy, renal impairment, radiation risks, and limited tissue sampling capability in CECT scans of the abdomen. In light of these challenges, this study evaluated the diagnostic capabilities of endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) compared to CECT for staging and vascular assessment of pancreatic cancer. Methods Fifty patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer underwent evaluations using both CECT scans and EUS, focusing on staging and vascular invasion assessment. Vascular evaluation was carried out using a categorization system based on EUS findings, classifying them into three types based on the tumor-vessel relationship: Type 1 indicating clear invasion or encasement of a vessel by a tumor or contact with a vessel wall exceeding 180 degrees, Type 2 representing abutment, wherein a tumor contacts a vessel wall but at an angle less than 180 degrees, and Type 3 implying clear non-invasion, where a discernible distance exists between a tumor and a vessel. In this categorization, Type 1 and Type 2 indicated signs of vascular invasion, while Type 3 indicated vascular non-invasion. These findings were subsequently compared to the results from CECT scans. The endoscopist performing EUS was blinded to the CT outcomes prior to the examination. Results Regarding pancreatic cancer staging, EUS exhibited remarkable sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy rates of 100% according to the T criterion.As for vascular invasion assessment, EUS demonstrated sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 100%, 95.93%, and 96%, respectively, for venous invasion. For arterial invasion, the figures were 95.65% sensitivity, 100% specificity, and an overall accuracy of 99.5%. Conclusion EUS is an effective modality for evaluating both staging and vascular invasion in pancreatic cancer, boasting exceptional sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy rates. The findings are robust enough to consider EUS a viable alternative to CT scans in evaluation, with the added advantage of EUS offering tissue sampling capability.",,El-Nady MA; Ead KA; Haridy MA; Shaheen N; Nashwan AJ; Abdelwahid SR; Mohammed MF; Mohamed O; Sawy SS; Abdelrazzak E; Hassan AM,Cureus,2024,Feb,Cureus. 2024 Feb 10;16(2):e53988. doi: 10.7759/cureus.53988. eCollection 2024 Feb.,United States,390,10928015
24212626,Diagnostic management of pancreatic cancer.,"Pancreatic cancer is one of the most deadly solid tumors, with an overall 5-year survival rate of less than 5%. Due to a non-specific clinical presentation, it is often diagnosed at an advanced stage and is rarely amenable for curative treatment. Therefore early diagnosis and appropriate staging are still essential to define the best care and to improve patient survival. Several imaging modalities are currently available for the evaluation of pancreatic cancer. This review focuses on different techniques and discusses the diagnostic management of patients with pancreatic cancer.

39632551,Anti-Cancer Effect of Sulforaphane in Human Pancreatic Cancer Cells Mia PaCa-2.,"BACKGROUND: Pancreatic cancer is difficult to treat early as it has no early symptoms. The presence of sulforaphane (SFN) in cruciferous vegetables has been found to possess anti-cancer effects in gastric and colon cancers. Glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3beta), a serine/threonine kinase, plays a significant role in pancreatic cancer progression, influencing tumor growth, metastasis, and treatment resistance. Targeting GSK-3beta has shown potential to enhance the efficacy of chemotherapy. However, the mechanism underlying the anticancer effects of SFN on pancreatic cancer through GSK-3beta is unclear. AIMS: In this study, we examined the anticancer effects of SFN in human pancreatic cancer cell line Mia PaCa-2 and evaluated its molecular mechanisms with respect to the GSK-3beta-related pathway. METHODS AND RESULTS: SFN increased the protein expression of the phosphorylated form of GSK3beta (Ser9). In the Wingless Int-1 homolog/beta-catenin pathway, GSK3beta induced apoptosis by phosphorylating beta-catenin. However, in mutant Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog-like-dependent cells such as Mia PaCa-2, GSK3beta was suppressed and the beta-catenin level was increased, thus inducing apoptosis. Indeed, SFN increased the protein expression of beta-catenin in the cytoplasm and nucleus. Subsequently, we measured the level of cMyc, the target gene of beta-catenin. SFN decreased cMyc expression despite an increase in the beta-catenin. We measured the expression of nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB, a downstream factor of GSK3beta and an upstream factor of cMyc. SFN decreased the expression of NF-kappaB and cMyc, indicating that SFN inhibits cell proliferation by suppressing the GSK3beta/NF-kappaB/cMyc pathway. As the suppression of NF-kappaB results in a decrease in B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) which is the anti-apoptotic gene, we tested the effect of SFN in the expression of BCL-2. SFN inhibited the expression of BCL-2 and increased the ratio of the apoptotic regulator gene BCL-2 associated X (BAX), where SFN induced the cleaved cysteine aspartase-3 and poly-adenosine diphosphate ribose polymerase. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that SFN may have therapeutic potential in the inhibition of pancreatic cancer.","Humans; *Isothiocyanates/pharmacology/therapeutic use; *Sulfoxides/pharmacology; *Pancreatic Neoplasms/drug therapy/pathology/metabolism/genetics; *Apoptosis/drug effects; *Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta/metabolism; Cell Line, Tumor; *beta Catenin/metabolism/genetics; Cell Proliferation/drug effects; Phosphorylation/drug effects; Anticarcinogenic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use; Signal Transduction/drug effects; Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3/metabolism",Park MJ; Kim YH,"Cancer reports (Hoboken, N.J.)",2024,Dec,Cancer Rep (Hoboken). 2024 Dec;7(12):e70074. doi: 10.1002/cnr2.70074.,United States,326,11617590
29805372,Gemcitabine-Induced Cardiotoxicity in Patients Receiving Adjuvant Chemotherapy for Pancreatic Cancer: A Case Series.,"Gemcitabine is not considered a cardiotoxic agent generally; so far only very few case reports have been reported in the literature on different aspects of cardiac side effects. Here we report a case series of 3 patients who developed congestive cardiac failure, when treated with gemcitabine monotherapy in the adjuvant setting for pancreatic cancers. Adjuvant chemotherapy with gemcitabine has been the standard of care for pancreatic cancer patients after successful surgery since the results of the CONKO-001 and ESPAC3 study were published. Gemcitabine was administered on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle at 1,000 mg/m(2). All 3 patients developed symptoms suggestive of cardiac failure with a drop in ejection fraction on echocardiography, and responded to conservative treatment for heart failure after withdrawal of gemcitabine therapy. Early withdrawal of gemcitabine chemotherapy is recommended in addition to a need for studies required to evaluate the mechanism of cardiotoxicity. As per available literature, patients with diabetes and having received a total dose greater than 15,000 mg/m(2) are generally at a higher risk and require close surveillance.",,Alam S; Illo C; Ma YT; Punia P,Case reports in oncology,2018,Jan-Apr,Case Rep Oncol. 2018 Apr 5;11(1):221-227. doi: 10.1159/000488139. eCollection 2018 Jan-Apr.,Switzerland,272,5968243
23009736,"Tumor size as measured at initial X-ray examination, not length of bile duct stricture, predicts survival in patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer.","BACKGROUND: The survival of unresectable pancreatic cancer patients is extremely poor. The aim of this study was to examine if tumor size could predict survival length in order to optimize patient care. METHODS: A retrospective observational study was performed on 185 consecutive patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer (ICD10: C250-2 and C258) who were diagnosed from 2003 to May 2010. The patients' initial radiographs at presentation of symptoms were reviewed by the same radiologist, and tumor extent was determined. RESULTS: The largest tumor diameter of the primary tumor was measured in 132 patients, 22 by an ultrasound and the other patients by a CT scan. In 53 patients, the tumor size could not be delimited and measured. Seventy-five patients (41%) had liver metastases at presentation of symptoms. Median survival for the entire patient group was only 119 days. The median diameter of the patient's largest tumor was 4.35 cm, while the sample groups ranged from 1.2 to 14 cm. Patients were divided into two groups: those with a largest tumor diameter of </= 4.3 cm (66 patients) and those with a largest tumor diameter of > 4.3 cm (66 patients). Median survival for these groups was 149 and 94 days (p = 0.019), respectively. Cox regression showed a hazard ratio for tumor size of 1.48 (95% CI 1.02, 2.07) (p = 0.038), adjusted for the gemcitabine treatment which had been given to 49 patients and the presence of liver metastasis. In 88 patients, stricture length could be measured at ERCP. When comparing stricture lengths of </= 2 cm and > 2 cm, no difference in survival time was noted within a Kaplan-Meier analysis. CONCLUSION: The size of the maximum tumor diameter of the primary tumor during the initial X-ray examination of patients with pancreatic cancer may predict survival time for those patients who had no surgical resection. Stricture length at ERCP gave no information on survival.","Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Bile Ducts/*pathology; Cholangiopancreatography, Endoscopic Retrograde/methods; Constriction, Pathologic/diagnostic imaging/pathology; Deoxycytidine/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use; Female; Humans; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Liver Neoplasms/diagnosis/diagnostic imaging/pathology/secondary; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Metastasis; Pancreatic Neoplasms/diagnosis/*diagnostic imaging/pathology; Prognosis; Retrospective Studies; Tomography, X-Ray Computed/methods; Gemcitabine",Forssell H; Proh K; Wester M; Krona H,BMC cancer,2012,Sep,BMC Cancer. 2012 Sep 25;12:429. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-12-429.,England,384,3522022
40391200,SKIL Promotes Pancreatic Cancer Metastasis by Inhibiting TSPYL2 to Activate the TGF-beta Pathway.,"BACKGROUND: Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD) represents a highly fatal form of cancer. The 5-year survival rate for patients with this disease is only around 10%. A significant hurdle in its management is the absence of characteristic early-stage symptoms. As a result, a large majority of pancreatic cancer patients are diagnosed when the disease has reached an advanced stage or has metastasized. Consequently, taking measures to suppress the occurrence of metastasis in pancreatic cancer can bring about a substantial improvement in patients' survival rates and overall prognosis. SKIL, known to promote cancer progression, is implicated in cell proliferation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and metastasis, but its specific function in pancreatic cancer remains unclear. METHODS: We investigated the effects of SKIL on the proliferation, apoptosis, and metastasis of pancreatic cancer cells. Through ChIP-seq, we identified the SKIL downstream target gene and further explored the mechanism by which SKIL regulates the metastasis of pancreatic cancer cells through functional experiments and Western blot. RESULTS: A high level of SKIL expression is associated with an unfavorable prognosis in PAAD; it promotes cell migration and EMT. Through ChIP-seq analysis, we identified that SKIL inhibits TSPYL2, a nuclear protein regulating the TGF-beta pathway by binding to the TGFB1 promoter. Further studies carried out by us confirmed that SKIL modulates the TGF-beta pathway via TSPYL2, facilitating EMT and metastasis in pancreatic cancer cells, independent of Smad4. CONCLUSIONS: These findings reveal a novel regulatory mechanism involving SKIL, TSPYL2, and the TGF-beta pathway, offering new therapeutic targets for PAAD.",,Wang C; Song W; Zhang Y; Deng H; Zhou Z; Zhu J; Wang X,Cancer innovation,2025,Jun,Cancer Innov. 2025 May 19;4(3):e70011. doi: 10.1002/cai2.70011. eCollection 2025 Jun.,England,429,12086372
35708464,Potentiality of raloxifene loaded melittin functionalized lipidic nanovesicles against pancreatic cancer cells.,"Pancreatic cancer (PC) frequency and incidence have grown rapidly in recent years. One of the most serious problems with PC is the existence of asymptotic manifestations, which frequently delays early detection, and until the diagnosis is established, tumor cells progress to the metastatic stage. Another significant concern with PC is the scarcity of well-defined pharmacotherapeutic drugs. The aim of this study was to develop an efficient nanocarrier system to augment the efficacy of raloxifene (RLX) against PC cells. As a result, the current investigation was carried out in order to give an effective treatment method, in which an optimum RLX loaded phospholipid-based vesicles with melittin (PL-MEL) was chosen using experimental design software, with particle size, zeta potential and entrapment efficiency % as dependent variables. Furthermore, anticancer activity against PANC1 cells was assessed. The optimized nanovesicle parameters were 172.5 nm for the measured size, zeta potential of -0.69 mV, and entrapment efficiency of 76.91% that were in good agreement with the expected ones. RLX-raw, plain formula, and optimized RLX-PL-MEL showed IC(50) concentrations of 26.07 +/- 0.98, 9.166 +/- 0.34, and 1.24 +/- 0.05 microg/mL, respectively. Furthermore, cell cycle analysis revealed that the nanovesicle was most effective in the G2-M phase, whereas Bax, and Bcl-2 estimates revealed that optimized RLX formula had the highest apoptotic activity among treatments investigated. However, as compared to RLX alone or plain formula alone, the optimized formula demonstrated higher expression of TNFalpha and Bax while a significant reduction of Bcl-2 and NF-kappaB expression was observed. mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) analysis confirmed the apoptosis as well as the anticancer effect of the optimized formula. Thus, the present study results showed an improvement in the anti-PC effects of the RLX with phospholipid conjugated melittin, making it a novel treatment approach against PC.",Humans; Melitten/pharmacology; *Pancreatic Neoplasms/drug therapy; Phospholipids; *Raloxifene Hydrochloride/pharmacology; bcl-2-Associated X Protein,Fahmy UA; Badr-Eldin SM; Aldawsari HM; Alhakamy NA; Ahmed OAA; Radwan MF; Eid BG; Sayed SRM; El Sherbiny GA; Abualsunun W,Drug delivery,2022,Dec,Drug Deliv. 2022 Dec;29(1):1863-1877. doi: 10.1080/10717544.2022.2072544.,England,424,9225738
32554375,Using an Interactive App for Symptom Reporting and Management Following Pancreatic Cancer Surgery to Facilitate Person-Centered Care: Descriptive Study.,"BACKGROUND: Pancreatic and periampullary cancers are rare but have high mortality rates. The only hope for cure is surgical removal of the tumor. Following pancreatic surgery, the patients have a great deal of responsibility for managing their symptoms. Patients report a lack of sufficient knowledge of self-care and unmet supportive care needs. This necessitates a health care system responsive to these needs and health care professionals who pay close attention to symptoms. Person-centered care is widely encouraged and means a shift from a model in which the patient is the passive object of care to a model involving the patient as an active participant in their own care. To address the challenges in care following pancreatic cancer surgery, an interactive app (Interaktor) was developed in which patients regularly report symptoms and receive support for self-care. The app has been shown to reduce patients' symptom burden and to increase their self-care activity levels following pancreaticoduodenectomy due to cancer. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to describe how patients used the Interaktor app following pancreaticoduodenectomy due to cancer and their experience with doing so. METHODS: A total of 115 patients were invited to use Interaktor for 6 months following pancreaticoduodenectomy. Of those, 35 declined, 8 dropped out, and 46 did not meet the inclusion criteria after surgery, leaving 26 patients for inclusion in the analysis. The patients were instructed to report symptoms daily through the app for up to 6 months following surgery. In case of alerting symptoms, they were contacted by their nurse. Data on reported symptoms, alerts, and viewed self-care advice were logged and analyzed with descriptive statistics. Also, the patients were interviewed about their experiences, and the data were analyzed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: The patients' median adherence to symptom reporting was 82%. Fatigue and pain were the most reported symptoms. Alerting symptoms were reported by 24 patients, and the most common alert was fever. There were variations in how many times the patients viewed the self-care advice (range 3-181 times). The most commonly viewed advice concerned pancreatic enzyme supplements. Through the interviews, the overarching theme was ""Being seen as a person,"" with the following 3 sub-themes: ""Getting your voice heard,"" ""Having access to an extended arm of health care,"" and ""Learning about own health."" CONCLUSIONS: Interaktor proved to be well accepted. It made patients feel reassured at home and offered support for self-care. The app facilitated person-centered care by its multiple features targeting individual supportive care needs and enabled participation in their own care. This supports our recent studies showing that patients using the app had less symptom burden and higher self-care activity levels than patients receiving only standard care.","Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Fatigue; Female; Health Personnel; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; *Mobile Applications; *Pancreatic Neoplasms/surgery; Self Care",Gustavell T; Sundberg K; Langius-Eklof A,JMIR mHealth and uHealth,2020,Jun,JMIR Mhealth Uhealth. 2020 Jun 17;8(6):e17855. doi: 10.2196/17855.,Canada,595,7330738
39553720,Investigation of the efficacy of siRNA-mediated KRAS gene silencing in pancreatic cancer therapy.,"AIM: Pancreatic carcinoma is an aggressive cancer that progresses without many symptoms. The difficulty of early diagnosis and an inadequate response to traditional treatments also cause the survival rate of pancreatic cancer to be low. Current research is focusing on methods of diagnosis and treatment, such as gene therapy, to increase survival rates. Small interfering ribonucleic acid (siRNA) has emerged as a promising advanced therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment. This study sought to silence the KRAS gene in the human pancreatic carcinoma cell line using a complex of small interfering ribonucleic acid (siRNA) and gold nanoparticles (AuNP). METHODS: In this study, 25 nM siRNA and gold nanoparticles at 0.5 mg/ml, 0.25 mg/ml, and 0.125 mg/ml concentrations were used to silence the KRAS gene in the CAPAN-1 cell line. Real-time PCR analysis, agarose gel electrophoresis, and double staining were carried out, and xCelligence real-time cell analysis (RTCA) was used to measure proliferation. RESULTS: The PCR analysis revealed crossing point (CP) values of actin beta (ACTB) ranging from 33.04 to 35.98, which was in the expected range for all samples. The interaction between the gold nanoparticle/siRNA complex in the double staining analysis revealed that the most effective concentration of gold nanoparticle was 0.125 mg/ml. The WST-1 technique showed that siRNA/AuPEI cells in application groups had a viability rate of over 90%, indicating no toxicity or side effects. The xCELLigence RTCA(R) showed that at hour 72, there was a significant difference in proliferation in the 0.5 mg/mL PEI/AuNP-siRNA, 0.25 mg/mL PEI/AuNP-siRNA, and 0.125 mg/mL PEI/AuNP-siRNA application groups compared to the control and siRNA groups (p < 0.05). By hour 96, all three groups were statistically different from the control and siRNA groups in terms of proliferation (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this analysis suggest that the AuPEI/siRNA complex can be effectively used to silence the target gene, but more studies are needed to verify these results.","Humans; *Pancreatic Neoplasms/genetics/therapy/pathology; *RNA, Small Interfering/administration & dosage/genetics/pharmacology; Cell Line, Tumor; *Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)/genetics/metabolism; *Metal Nanoparticles/chemistry; *Gold/chemistry; *Gene Silencing; Cell Proliferation/drug effects/genetics; Genetic Therapy/methods",Kucukekmekci B; Budak Yildiran FA,PeerJ,2024,,PeerJ. 2024 Nov 12;12:e18214. doi: 10.7717/peerj.18214. eCollection 2024.,United States,404,11566511
36407358,The effects of Juglone-Selenium combination on invasion and metastasis in pancreatic cancer cell lines.,"BACKGROUND: Pancreatic cancer does not show any symptoms in the early period and metastatic process is already passed when the diagnosis is done. Therefore, in the battle with pancreatic cancer, novel treatment strategies, particularly antiinvasive and antimetastatic strategies, are needed. The cytotoxic and anticancer effects of juglone and sodium selenite (NaSe) have been showed in various cancer cells. OBJECTIVES: In this study, it is aimed to investigate the synergistic effects of juglone and selenium on PANC-1 and BxPC-3 pancreatic cancer cells. METHODS: Antimetastatic effects of juglone-NaSe were carried out by adhesion and invasion assays and the genes and protein expressions. Expression analysis of the CDH1, ITGB3 and COL4A3 genes and their proteins E-cadherin, beta3 integrin and tumstatin which play role in metastasis and angiogenesis processes, were done by qPCR and immunohistochemical analysis, respectively. RESULTS: Study findings have provided evidences that the juglone-selenium has a cytotoxic and dose dependent suppressive effect on invasion and metastasis in PANC-1 and BxPC-3 cells. CONCLUSION: The juglone-NaSe has the potential to be a promising agent especially to inhibit invasion and metastasis in pancreatic cancer treatment. However, more in depth studies are needed to more clearly demonstrate the effects of juglone-selenium.","Humans; *Selenium/therapeutic use; Cell Line, Tumor; *Pancreatic Neoplasms/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology; *Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use",Arikoglu H; Dursunoglu D; Kaya DE; Avci E,African health sciences,2022,Jun,Afr Health Sci. 2022 Jun;22(2):334-342. doi: 10.4314/ahs.v22i2.37.,Uganda,225,9652687
39198617,Early detection of pancreatic cancer by comprehensive serum miRNA sequencing with automated machine learning.,"BACKGROUND: Pancreatic cancer is often diagnosed at advanced stages, and early-stage diagnosis of pancreatic cancer is difficult because of nonspecific symptoms and lack of available biomarkers. METHODS: We performed comprehensive serum miRNA sequencing of 212 pancreatic cancer patient samples from 14 hospitals and 213 non-cancerous healthy control samples. We randomly classified the pancreatic cancer and control samples into two cohorts: a training cohort (N = 185) and a validation cohort (N = 240). We created ensemble models that combined automated machine learning with 100 highly expressed miRNAs and their combination with CA19-9 and validated the performance of the models in the independent validation cohort. RESULTS: The diagnostic model with the combination of the 100 highly expressed miRNAs and CA19-9 could discriminate pancreatic cancer from non-cancer healthy control with high accuracy (area under the curve (AUC), 0.99; sensitivity, 90%; specificity, 98%). We validated high diagnostic accuracy in an independent asymptomatic early-stage (stage 0-I) pancreatic cancer cohort (AUC:0.97; sensitivity, 67%; specificity, 98%). CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that the 100 highly expressed miRNAs and their combination with CA19-9 could be biomarkers for the specific and early detection of pancreatic cancer.","Humans; *Pancreatic Neoplasms/blood/genetics/diagnosis; *Early Detection of Cancer/methods; *Machine Learning; Female; Male; Middle Aged; *MicroRNAs/blood; *Biomarkers, Tumor/blood/genetics; Aged; CA-19-9 Antigen/blood; Case-Control Studies; Adult",Kawai M; Fukuda A; Otomo R; Obata S; Minaga K; Asada M; Umemura A; Uenoyama Y; Hieda N; Morita T; Minami R; Marui S; Yamauchi Y; Nakai Y; Takada Y; Ikuta K; Yoshioka T; Mizukoshi K; Iwane K; Yamakawa G; Namikawa M; Sono M; Nagao M; Maruno T; Nakanishi Y; Hirai M; Kanda N; Shio S; Itani T; Fujii S; Kimura T; Matsumura K; Ohana M; Yazumi S; Kawanami C; Yamashita Y; Marusawa H; Watanabe T; Ito Y; Kudo M; Seno H,British journal of cancer,2024,Oct,Br J Cancer. 2024 Oct;131(7):1158-1168. doi: 10.1038/s41416-024-02794-5.

32147669,"Phase 1 study of the pan-HER inhibitor dacomitinib plus the MEK1/2 inhibitor PD-0325901 in patients with KRAS-mutation-positive colorectal, non-small-cell lung and pancreatic cancer.","BACKGROUND: Mutations in KRAS result in a constitutively activated MAPK pathway. In KRAS-mutant tumours existing treatment options, e.g. MEK inhibition, have limited efficacy due to resistance through feedback activation of epidermal growth factor receptors (HER). METHODS: In this Phase 1 study, the pan-HER inhibitor dacomitinib was combined with the MEK1/2 inhibitor PD-0325901 in patients with KRAS-mutant colorectal, pancreatic and non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Patients received escalating oral doses of once daily dacomitinib and twice daily PD-0325901 to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D). (Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT02039336). RESULTS: Eight out of 41 evaluable patients (27 colorectal cancer, 11 NSCLC and 3 pancreatic cancer) among 8 dose levels experienced dose-limiting toxicities. The RP2D with continuous dacomitinib dosing was 15 mg of dacomitinib plus 6 mg of PD-0325901 (21 days on/7 days off), but major toxicity, including rash (85%), diarrhoea (88%) and nausea (63%), precluded long-term treatment. Therefore, other intermittent schedules were explored, which only slightly improved toxicity. Tumour regression was seen in eight patients with the longest treatment duration (median 102 days) in NSCLC. CONCLUSIONS: Although preliminary signs of antitumour activity in NSCLC were seen, we do not recommend further exploration of this combination in KRAS-mutant patients due to its negative safety profile.","Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use; Benzamides/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/drug therapy/genetics; Colorectal Neoplasms/drug therapy/genetics; Diphenylamine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics; ErbB Receptors/*antagonists & inhibitors; Female; Humans; Lung Neoplasms/drug therapy/genetics; Male; Middle Aged; Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors; *Mutation; Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics; Pancreatic Neoplasms/drug therapy/genetics; Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)/*genetics; Quinazolinones/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics",van Geel RMJM; van Brummelen EMJ; Eskens FALM; Huijberts SCFA; de Vos FYFL; Lolkema MPJK; Devriese LA; Opdam FL; Marchetti S; Steeghs N; Monkhorst K; Thijssen B; Rosing H; Huitema ADR; Beijnen JH; Bernards R; Schellens JHM,British journal of cancer,2020,Apr,Br J Cancer. 2020 Apr;122(8):1166-1174. doi: 10.1038/s41416-020-0776-z.

34055415,Prevalence of Insomnia among Pancreatic Cancer Patients following Pancreaticoduodenectomy.,"INTRODUCTION: Sleep disturbances are more common in cancer patients than in the general population; however, there is limited research pertaining to the occurrence of such disturbances that subsequently impact patients' quality of life. The aim of our study is to describe the prevalence of insomnia among pancreatic cancer patients who have recently undergone recent pancreaticoduodenectomy. METHODS: We performed a 6-year (2014-2020) retrospective cohort analysis of all adult patients aged 18 and above with pancreatic cancer who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy at our institution. Insomnia was characterized using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Symptoms of insomnia and the impact caused by these symptoms on daily lives were assessed with the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), and patients were divided into mild insomnia (ISI 8-14) or moderate to severe insomnia (ISI >/= 15). RESULTS: Out of forty patients with pancreatic cancer that have undergone pancreaticoduodenectomy, 19 (47.2%) reported that their sleep disturbances had a significant effect on their quality of life. A total of 22 (55.0%) patients reported insomnia, with 63.2% reporting mild insomnia. Chemotherapy was found to significantly increase the risk of moderate to severe insomnia. The mean ISI score was 7.2 +/- 6.9, and the mean PSQI score was 7.0 +/- 5.1. ISI and PSQI showed a strong positive correlation (r = 0.78, p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Sleep disturbances such as insomnia following pancreatic cancer surgery are highly prevalent. Treating physicians and surgeons should recognize and routinely screen for sleep disorders through the management of a multidisciplinary team in order to alleviate some of the burden on the patients' mental well-being.",,Chalhoub S; Yaghi M; Ard N; Kanso M; Allam J; Khalife M; Jaafar RF; Faraj W,Sleep disorders,2021,,Sleep Disord. 2021 May 4;2021:5535220. doi: 10.1155/2021/5535220. eCollection 2021.,United States,296,8112949
35148665,"Diagnosing pancreatic cancer in general practice: a cross-sectional study on associations between suspicion of cancer, urgent referral and time to diagnosis.","OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the first point of contact in patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, and to study factors associated with the GP's suspicion of cancer, Cancer Patient Pathway (CPP) referral and long diagnostic interval. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study combining register and survey data. PATIENTS: Patients with incident pancreatic cancer recorded in the Danish National Patient Register (n = 303). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The patient's first point of symptoms presentation, GP's cancer suspicion, CPP referral and diagnostic interval. RESULTS: General practice was the first point of contact for 85.5% of the population. At the first consultation, cancer was suspected in 32.7% and 22.9% were referred to a CPP. The GPs were more likely to suspect cancer or serious illness in patients aged >70 years (prevalence rate ratio (PRR) 1.34, 95% CI 1.09-1.66) and among patients with high comorbidity (PRR 1.23, 95% CI 1.04-1.47). A CPP referral was less likely among patients with low education. The median diagnostic interval was 39 days (interquartile range: 15-72). When the GP initially did not suspect cancer, the likelihood of longer diagnostic interval increased. CONCLUSION: The majority of patients with pancreatic cancer began their diagnostic route in general practice. Diagnosing pancreatic cancer swiftly in general practice was challenging; the GP did often not initially suspect cancer or refer to a CPP and several of the patient characteristics were associated with the GPs initial suspicion of cancer or CPP referral. Thus, there may be room for improvements in the diagnostics of pancreatic cancer in general practice.Key pointsPatients with pancreatic cancer have a poor prognosis, as pancreatic cancer is often diagnosed in late stage.The majority of patients with pancreatic cancer began their diagnostic process in general practice.General practitioners (GPs) suspected cancer at the first consultation in one out of three patients with pancreatic cancer; more often in older and comorbid patients.The GPs suspicion of cancer was associated with urgent referral and shorter time to diagnosis.",Aged; Cross-Sectional Studies; *General Practice; *General Practitioners; Humans; *Pancreatic Neoplasms/diagnosis; Referral and Consultation; Surveys and Questionnaires,Virgilsen LF; Rasmussen LA; Vedsted P; Jensen H,Scandinavian journal of primary health care,2022,Mar,Scand J Prim Health Care. 2022 Mar;40(1):78-86. doi: 10.1080/02813432.2022.2036491.

31210656,Frequency of Appropriate Use of Pancreatic Enzyme Replacement Therapy and Symptomatic Response in Pancreatic Cancer Patients.,"OBJECTIVES: Pancreatic cancer (PC) and its treatments can result in pancreatic exocrine insufficiency that requires pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT). Appropriate PERT usage is during meals and snacks. The aim was to determine the frequency of appropriate use of PERT and its impact on symptom alleviation in PC through a patient-reported outcomes online platform. METHODS: Users in the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network's Patient Registry were prompted to answer a standalone questionnaire about their experience with PERT. RESULTS: Two hundred sixty-two users completed the PERT questionnaire (January 2016-January 2018). Patients who reported taking PERT with meals had higher alleviation of symptoms compared with those taking PERT prior to or after meals. Specifically, ""feeling of indigestion,"" ""light-colored or orange stools,"" and ""visible food particles in stool"" were significantly decreased. Patients taking PERT with meals reported weight gain and less weight loss. CONCLUSIONS: Of the 89% of PC patients prescribed PERT, 65% were prescribed PERT appropriately with all meals and snacks. Overall compliance with PERT administration guidelines was low (50% [105/208]). Improvement in symptoms significantly correlated with appropriate use of PERT. Increase in PC patient and provider education about appropriate PERT usage and administration is warranted.","Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Enzyme Replacement Therapy/*methods; Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency/complications/diagnosis/*drug therapy; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pancreas/*drug effects/enzymology/pathology; Pancreatic Neoplasms/complications/diagnosis/*drug therapy; Pancrelipase/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use; Retrospective Studies; Surveys and Questionnaires; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult",Barkin JA; Westermann A; Hoos W; Moravek C; Matrisian L; Wang H; Shemanski L; Barkin JS; Rahib L,Pancreas,2019,Jul,Pancreas. 2019 Jul;48(6):780-786. doi: 10.1097/MPA.0000000000001330.,United States,250,6749961
32429928,RNA demethylase ALKBH5 prevents pancreatic cancer progression by posttranscriptional activation of PER1 in an m6A-YTHDF2-dependent manner.,"BACKGROUND: N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most abundant reversible methylation modification of eukaryotic mRNA, and it plays vital roles in tumourigenesis. This study aimed to explore the role of the m6A demethylase ALKBH5 in pancreatic cancer (PC). METHODS: The expression of ALKBH5 and its clinicopathological impact were evaluated in PC cohorts. The effects of ALKBH5 on the biological characteristics of PC cells were investigated on the basis of gain-of-function and loss-of-function analyses. Subcutaneous and orthotopic models further uncovered the role of ALKBH5 in tumour growth. mRNA and m6A sequencing and assays of m6A methylated RNA immunoprecipitation-qPCR (MeRIP-qPCR) were performed to identify the targeted effect of ALKBH5 on PER1. P53-binding sites in the ALKBH5 promoter were investigated by ChIP and luciferase assays to reveal the interplay between ALKBH5 and PER1-activated ATM-CHK2-P53/CDC25C signalling. RESULTS: ALKBH5 loss characterized the occurrence and poor clinicopathological manifestations in patients with PC. Overexpression of ALKBH5 reduced tumoural proliferative, migrative, invasive activities in vitro and ameliorated tumour growth in vivo, whereas ALKBH5 knockdown facilitated PC progression. Mechanistically, ALKBH5 posttranscriptionally activated PER1 by m6A demethylation in an m6A-YTHDF2-dependent manner. PER1 upregulation led to the reactivation of ATM-CHK2-P53/CDC25C signalling, which inhibited cell growth. P53-induced activation of ALKBH5 transcription acted as a feedback loop regulating the m6A modifications in PC. CONCLUSION: ALKBH5 serves as a PC suppressor by regulating the posttranscriptional activation of PER1 through m6A abolishment, which may highlight a demethylation-based approach for PC diagnosis and therapy.","Adenosine/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry; AlkB Homolog 5, RNA Demethylase/genetics/*metabolism; Animals; Apoptosis; Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/metabolism; Cell Movement; Cell Proliferation; Female; *Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; Male; Mice; Mice, Nude; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Invasiveness; Pancreatic Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism/*pathology; Period Circadian Proteins/*genetics/metabolism; Prognosis; RNA Processing, Post-Transcriptional; RNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism; Survival Rate; *Transcriptional Activation; Tumor Cells, Cultured; Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays",Guo X; Li K; Jiang W; Hu Y; Xiao W; Huang Y; Feng Y; Pan Q; Wan R,Molecular cancer,2020,May,Mol Cancer. 2020 May 19;19(1):91. doi: 10.1186/s12943-020-01158-w.,England,259,7236181
30799929,"The effectiveness of pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy for malabsorption in advanced pancreatic cancer, a pilot study.","Advanced adenocarcinoma of the pancreas has a globally poor prognosis. One of the characteristic features of pancreatic cancer (PC) is pancreatic exocrine insufficiency (PEI). This leads to a malabsorption syndrome and subsequent digestive symptoms. Given the high prevalence of PEI and malabsorption in PC, empiric use of pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) is recommended. The aim of this pilot study was to determine the potential efficacy of PERT in improving symptoms and quality of life in those with metastatic PC. The study recruited patients with advanced PC referred to a specialist palliative care service. Following an initial assessment, patients were commenced on pancrealipase 25,000IU (Creon) and reassessed after 1 week and 3 weeks post-initiation of supplementation. These assessments included demographics, malabsorption symptom checklist, and completion of two validated quality-of-life questionnaires, the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ-C30 and QLQ-PAN26. PERT was associated with statistically significant improvement of symptoms in both the general (QLQ-C30) and pancreatic cancer specific tool (PAN26). Within 1 week of PERT initiation, there was a reduction in diarrhoea scores (26 vs. 8, p<0.005), pancreatic and hepatic pain (47 vs. 33 and 24 vs. 11, respectively, p<0.05). After 3 weeks, there were significant improvements in pancreatic pain and bloating/gas symptoms (47 vs. 26 and 46 vs. 26, respectively, p< 0.005).

A subset of patients who underwent TP even died due to severe hypoglycemia. For pancreatic cancer involving the pancreatic head and proximal body but without invasion to the pancreatic tail, we performed partial pancreatic tail preserving subtotal pancreatectomy (PPTP-SP) in selected patients, in order to improve postoperative glycemic control and QoL without compromising oncological outcomes. AIM: To evaluate the efficacy of PPTP-SP for patients with pancreatic cancer. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 56 patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma who underwent PPTP-SP (n = 18) or TP (n = 38) at our institution from May 2014 to January 2019. Clinical outcomes were compared between the two groups, with an emphasis on oncological outcomes, postoperative glycemic control, and QoL. QoL was evaluated using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30 and EORTC PAN26). All patients were followed until May 2019 or until death. RESULTS: A total of 56 consecutive patients were enrolled in this study. Perioperative outcomes, recurrence-free survival, and overall survival were comparable between the two groups. No patients in the PPTP-SP group developed cancer recurrence in the pancreatic tail stump or splenic hilum, or a clinical pancreatic fistula. Patients who underwent PPTP-SP had significantly better glycemic control, based on their higher rate of insulin-independence (P = 0.014), lower hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level (P = 0.046), lower daily insulin dosage (P < 0.001), and less frequent hypoglycemic episodes (P < 0.001). Global health was similar in the two groups, but patients who underwent PPTP-SP had better functional status (P = 0.036), milder symptoms (P = 0.013), less severe diet restriction (P = 0.011), and higher confidence regarding future life (P = 0.035).

33593396,Coupled liquid biopsy and bioinformatics for pancreatic cancer early detection and precision prognostication.,"Early detection and diagnosis are the key to successful clinical management of pancreatic cancer and improve the patient outcome. However, due to the absence of early symptoms and the aggressiveness of pancreatic cancer, its 5-year survival rate remains below 5 %. Compared to tissue samples, liquid biopsies are of particular interest in clinical settings with respect to minimal invasiveness, repeated sampling, complete representation of the entire or multi-site tumor bulks. The potential of liquid biopsies in pancreatic cancer has been demonstrated by many studies which prove that liquid biopsies are able to detect early emergency of pancreatic cancer cells, residual disease, and recurrence. More interestingly, they show potential to delineate the heterogeneity, spatial and temporal, of pancreatic cancer. However, the performance of liquid biopsies for the diagnosis varies largely across different studies depending of the technique employed and also the type and stage of the tumor. One approach to improve the detect performance of liquid biopsies is to intensively inspect circulome and to define integrated biomarkers which simultaneously profile circulating tumor cells and DNA, extracellular vesicles, and circulating DNA, or cell free DNA and proteins. Moreover, the diagnostic validity and accuracy of liquid biopsies still need to be comprehensively demonstrated and validated.","Biomarkers, Tumor/*blood/genetics; Circulating Tumor DNA/genetics; Computational Biology/*methods; Early Detection of Cancer; Humans; Liquid Biopsy; Neoplastic Cells, Circulating/pathology; Pancreatic Neoplasms/*diagnosis/genetics/pathology; Precision Medicine; Survival Analysis",Hou J; Li X; Xie KP,Molecular cancer,2021,Feb,Mol Cancer. 2021 Feb 16;20(1):34. doi: 10.1186/s12943-021-01309-7.,England,263,7888169
34721766,Liquid biopsy approach to pancreatic cancer.,"Pancreatic cancer (PC) continues to pose a major clinical challenge. There has been little improvement in patient survival over the past few decades, and it is projected to become the second leading cause of cancer mortality by 2030. The dismal 5-year survival rate of less than 10% after the diagnosis is attributable to the lack of early symptoms, the absence of specific biomarkers for an early diagnosis, and the inadequacy of available chemotherapies. Most patients are diagnosed when the disease has already metastasized and cannot be treated. Cancer interception is vital, actively intervening in the malignization process before the development of a full-blown advanced tumor. An early diagnosis of PC has a dramatic impact on the survival of patients, and improved techniques are urgently needed to detect and evaluate this disease at an early stage. It is difficult to obtain tissue biopsies from the pancreas due to its anatomical position; however, liquid biopsies are readily available and can provide useful information for the diagnosis, prognosis, stratification, and follow-up of patients with PC and for the design of individually tailored treatments. The aim of this review was to provide an update of the latest advances in knowledge on the application of carbohydrates, proteins, cell-free nucleic acids, circulating tumor cells, metabolome compounds, exosomes, and platelets in blood as potential biomarkers for PC, focusing on their clinical relevance and potential for improving patient outcomes.",,Perales S; Torres C; Jimenez-Luna C; Prados J; Martinez-Galan J; Sanchez-Manas JM; Caba O,World journal of gastrointestinal oncology,2021,Oct,World J Gastrointest Oncol. 2021 Oct 15;13(10):1263-1287. doi: 10.4251/wjgo.v13.i10.1263.,China,503,8529923
40213200,Cerebellopontine angle metastasis from pancreatic cancer: a case report.,"INTRODUCTION: Pancreatic cancer metastasis to the cerebellopontine angle (CPA) is extremely rare and often misdiagnosed preoperatively. The clinical characteristics and prognosis of this uncommon condition remain largely unknown. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 68-year-old male who presented with recurrent headaches, dizziness, and gait disturbances. The patient had undergone pancreaticoduodenectomy for pancreatic head adenocarcinoma two years prior. Preoperative imaging suggested a right CPA meningioma. The patient underwent resection of the CPA tumor under general anesthesia. Postoperative pathology revealed a metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Despite treatment with adjuvant chemotherapy, the patient developed widespread metastatic disease and succumbed 2 months after the CPA tumor resection. DISCUSSION: The rarity of pancreatic cancer metastasizing to the CPA presents diagnostic challenges, as evidenced by the initial misdiagnosis of meningioma in this case. The clinical presentation can mimic benign conditions, leading to delays in appropriate management. This case underscores the importance of considering metastatic disease in patients with a history of cancer, even when presenting with symptoms typical of more common CPA lesions. CONCLUSION: Vigilant monitoring is crucial in pancreatic cancer patients, as neurological symptoms may herald metastatic spread to uncommon sites like the CPA. Despite surgical intervention, widespread metastasis can lead to poor outcomes. Early diagnosis and a high index of suspicion are essential for optimal management of these rare cases.",,Wang T; Pu K; Lin X; Li Z; Wu J; Shao D; Zhao N,Annals of medicine and surgery (2012),2025,Mar,Ann Med Surg (Lond). 2024 Sep 10;87(3):1652-1655. doi: 10.1097/MS9.0000000000002557. eCollection 2025 Mar.,England,277,11981310
38831230,Patient-reported use of pancreatic enzyme replacement treatment (PERT) in pancreatic cancer in New Zealand and Australia: a cross-sectional survey study.,"PURPOSE: This study investigated pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) use in people diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in New Zealand (NZ) and Australia (AU). METHODS: A cross-sectional survey study was conducted using a mixed-media campaign to recruit people with pancreatic cancer and collect information about current PERT use. The questionnaire gathered data on participant demographics, awareness of PERT, prescribing practices and efficacy of enzyme replacement. RESULTS: Over 300 people with pancreatic cancer were recruited, 135 from New Zealand and 199 from Australia. Every region, state and territory was represented except for the West Coast (NZ) and the Northern Territory (AU), the lowest populated areas in both countries. In New Zealand, 60% of participants had heard about PERT, compared to 69.3% in Australia. Dosing regimens were inconsistent in both countries, with 18% and 27% of participants being prescribed PERT considered best practice in New Zealand and Australia, respectively. Before PERT commencement, 70% of participants experienced symptoms of malabsorption, with all symptoms improving after therapy was established. The majority of participants were compliant with their medication. CONCLUSION: PERT use in pancreatic cancer in New Zealand and Australia was highly variable and not compliant with international guidelines in which PERT is recommended as standard therapy. Enzyme replacement is effective for improving the symptoms of malabsorption in patients with pancreatic cancer. Clinician education may be needed to help improve the use of PERT in people with pancreatic cancer.","Humans; Cross-Sectional Studies; *Pancreatic Neoplasms/drug therapy; New Zealand; Female; Male; *Enzyme Replacement Therapy/methods; Middle Aged; Australia; Aged; Surveys and Questionnaires; Adult; Aged, 80 and over",Landers A; Brown H; Al Ruheili J; Russell K; McKenzie C; Agar MR; Yenson VM; Clarke K; Windsor J,Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,2024,Jun,Support Care Cancer. 2024 Jun 3;32(6):402. doi: 10.1007/s00520-024-08604-1.,Germany,404,11147847
37894296,Patients with Advanced Pancreatic Cancer Treated with Mistletoe and Hyperthermia in Addition to Palliative Chemotherapy: A Retrospective Single-Center Analysis.,"This retrospective analysis investigated the influence of integrative therapies in addition to palliative chemotherapy in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer, treated at a single institution specialized in integrative oncology between January 2015 and December 2019. In total, 206 consecutive patients were included in the study, whereof 142 patients (68.9%) received palliative chemotherapy (gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel 33.8%; FOLFIRINOX 35.9%; gemcitabine 30.3%) while the remainder were treated with best supportive and integrative care. Integrative therapies were used in 117 of 142 patients (82.4%) in addition to conventional chemotherapy, whereby mistletoe was used in 117 patients (82.4%) and hyperthermia in 74 patients (52.1%). A total of 107/142 patients (86.3%) died during the observation period, whereby survival times differed significantly depending on the additional use of integrative mistletoe or hyperthermia: chemotherapy alone 8.6 months (95% CI 4.7-15.4), chemotherapy and only mistletoe therapy 11.2 months (95% CI 7.1-14.2), or a combination of chemotherapy with mistletoe and hyperthermia 18.9 months (95% CI 15.2-24.5). While the survival times observed for patients with advanced pancreatic cancer receiving chemotherapy alone are consistent with pivotal phase-III studies and German registry data, we found significantly improved survival using additional mistletoe and/or hyperthermia.",,Hohneck AL; Sadikaj L; Heinemann L; Schroeder M; Riess H; Gerhards A; Burkholder I; Heckel-Reusser S; Gottfried J; Hofheinz RD,Cancers,2023,Oct,Cancers (Basel). 2023 Oct 11;15(20):4929. doi: 10.3390/cancers15204929.,Switzerland,448,10605673
26470767,A Comparison of Gastrointestinal Toxicities between Intensity-Modulated Radiotherapy and Three-Dimensional Conformal Radiotherapy for Pancreatic Cancer.,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: Concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) is considered the treatment option for locally advanced pancreatic cancer, but accompanying gastrointestinal toxicities are the most common complication. With the introduction of three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3-D CRT) and intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), CCRT-related adverse events are expected to diminish. Here, we evaluated the benefits of radiation modalities by comparing gastrointestinal toxicities between 3-D CRT and IMRT. METHODS: Patients who received CCRT between July 2010 and June 2012 in Severance Hospital, Yonsei University College of Medicine, were enrolled prospectively. The patients underwent upper endoscopy before and 1 month after CCRT. RESULTS: A total of 84 patients were enrolled during the study period. The radiotherapy modalities delivered included 3D-CRT (n=40) and IMRT (n=44). The median follow-up period from the start of CCRT was 10.6 months (range, 3.8 to 29.9 months). The symptoms of dyspepsia, nausea/vomiting, and diarrhea did not differ between the groups. Upper endoscopy revealed significantly more gastroduodenal ulcers in the 3-D CRT group (p=0.003). The modality of radiotherapy (3D-CRT; odds ratio [OR], 11.67; p=0.011) and tumor location (body of pancreas; OR, 11.06; p=0.009) were risk factors for gastrointestinal toxicities. CONCLUSIONS: IMRT is associated with significantly fewer gastroduodenal injuries among patients treated with CCRT for pancreatic cancer.","Aged; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Gastrointestinal Diseases/*etiology; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pancreatic Neoplasms/*radiotherapy; Prospective Studies; Radiation Injuries/*complications; Radiotherapy, Conformal/*adverse effects; Radiotherapy, Intensity-Modulated/*adverse effects; Risk Factors",Lee KJ; Yoon HI; Chung MJ; Park JY; Bang S; Park SW; Seong JS; Song SY,Gut and liver,2016,Mar,Gut Liver. 2016 Mar;10(2):303-9. doi: 10.5009/gnl15186.,Korea (South),212,4780462
31273624,Exploring the patient experience of locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer to inform patient-reported outcomes assessment.,"PURPOSE: Pancreatic cancer and its treatments impact patients' symptoms, functioning, and quality of life. Content-valid patient-reported outcome (PRO) instruments are required to assess outcomes in clinical trials. This study aimed to: (a) conceptualise the patient experience of pancreatic cancer; (b) identify relevant PRO instruments; (c) review the content validity of mapped instruments to guide PRO measurement in clinical trials. METHODS: Qualitative literature and interviews with clinicians and patients were analysed thematically to develop a conceptual model of patient experience. PRO instruments were reviewed against the conceptual model to identify gaps in measurement. Cognitive debriefing explored PRO conceptual relevance and patients' understanding. RESULTS: Patients in the USA (N = 24, aged 35-84) and six clinicians (from US and Europe) were interviewed. Pre-diagnosis, pain was the most frequently reported symptom (N = 21). Treatments included surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy. Surgery was associated with acute pain and gastrointestinal symptoms. Chemotherapy/chemoradiation side effects were cyclical and included fatigue/tiredness (N = 21), appetite loss (N = 15), bowel problems (N = 15), and nausea/vomiting (N = 15). Patients' functioning and well-being were impaired. The literature review identified 49 PRO measures; the EORTC QLQ-C30/PAN26 were used most frequently and mapped with interview concepts. Patients found the EORTC QLQ-C30/PAN26 to be understandable and relevant; neuropathic side effects were suggested additions. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to develop a conceptual model of patients' experience of metastatic/recurrent pancreatic cancer and explore the content validity of the EORTC QLQ-C30/PAN26 following therapeutic advances. The EORTC QLQ-C30/PAN26 appears conceptually relevant; additional items to assess neuropathic side effects are recommended. A recall period should be stated throughout to standardise responses.","Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Metastasis; Pancreatic Neoplasms/*epidemiology/*psychology; *Patient Reported Outcome Measures; Quality of Life/*psychology; Surveys and Questionnaires",Herman JM; Kitchen H; Degboe A; Aldhouse NVJ; Trigg A; Hodgin M; Narang A; Johnson CD,"Quality of life research : an international journal of quality of life aspects of treatment, care and rehabilitation",2019,Nov,Qual Life Res. 2019 Nov;28(11):2929-2939. doi: 10.1007/s11136-019-02233-6.

32811429,Left-sided portal hypertension caused by peripancreatic lymph node tuberculosis misdiagnosed as pancreatic cancer: a case report and literature review.,"BACKGROUND: Left-sided portal hypertension (LSPH) is an extremely rare clinical syndrome, and it is the only form of curable portal hypertension. It is primarily caused by pancreatic disease, and is associated with complications that cause spleen vein compression. Specific symptoms are often lacking, rendering it difficult to diagnose. Splenectomy is the main treatment for cases complicated by variceal bleeding, and the effects of treatment primarily depend on the condition of the primary disease. CASE PRESENTATION: The patient was a 29-year-old woman who was admitted to the hospital for repeated hematemesis and black stool. She had been misdiagnosed with pancreatic cancer 7 years prior. Combined imaging and endoscopic examination indicated varicose gastric fundus veins, a pancreatic mass, and enlarged peripancreatic lymph nodes. Laboratory investigations revealed reduced erythrocyte, platelet, and leukocyte counts, the interferon gamma release assay was positive, and liver function was normal. Abdominal exploration, splenectomy, varicose vein dissection, and lesion resection were performed via laparotomy. Postoperative biopsy analysis confirmed the diagnosis of lymph node tuberculosis. Based on the above-described factors, LSPH caused by peripancreatic lymph node tuberculosis was a diagnosed. CONCLUSIONS: Herein we describe the first reported case of LSPH caused by peripancreatic lymph node tuberculosis. When left portal hypertension occurs simultaneously, peripancreatic lymph node tuberculosis is often misdiagnosed as pancreatic cancer. Further studies are necessary to develop a more favorable diagnostic method for pancreas masses and more advantageous therapy for LSPH, especially in cases caused by mechanical compression.","Adult; Diagnostic Errors; *Esophageal and Gastric Varices/etiology; Female; Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage; Humans; *Hypertension, Portal/diagnosis/etiology; Lymph Nodes; *Pancreatic Neoplasms/complications/diagnosis; *Tuberculosis, Lymph Node",Yu D; Li X; Gong J; Li J; Xie F; Hu J,BMC gastroenterology,2020,Aug,BMC Gastroenterol. 2020 Aug 18;20(1):276. doi: 10.1186/s12876-020-01420-x.,England,293,7436982
25381564,Multiple tumor marker protein chip detection system in diagnosis of pancreatic cancer.,"BACKGROUND: The clinical stage of the disease at diagnosis often determines the prognosis and survival rate of a patient with pancreatic cancer. Early symptoms of pancreatic cancer are often not obvious on imaging (ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), and so on), and when patients present with weight loss, jaundice and abdominal pain and other symptoms, they are usually already in the advanced stages of pancreatic cancer. However, the examination of combined tumor markers might improve their sensitivity or specificity in aiding diagnosis. METHODS: Twelve tumor markers including AFP, CEA, NSE, CA125, CA15-3, CA242, CA19-9, PSA, f-PSA, FER, beta-HCG and HGH were measured by the protein biochip detection in serum in 235 pancreatic cancer patients, 230 benign pancreatic disease patients and 240 healthy people. RESULTS: Positive detection rates of tumor markers were: CA19-9 (49.3%), CA125 (45.1%), FER (44.2%), CA242 (42.5%), CEA (38.6%), CA15-3 (36.7%), beta-HCG (29.6%), AFP (24.5%), NSE (18.2%), PSA (19.5%), f-PSA (9.4%) and HGH (8.7%) respectively. There was significant difference in CA19-9, NSE, CEA, CA242 and CA125 by multi-tumor marker protein biochip detection among patients with cancer, benign disease and healthy people (P<0.05). The positive rate of 5 tumor markers was 94.9%, and this was much higher than that of any single marker. CONCLUSION: The detection of CA19-9, NSE, CEA, CA242 and CA125 in the multi-tumor marker protein biochip system is helpful in the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer.","Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology; Biomarkers, Tumor/*blood; Case-Control Studies; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Staging; Pancreatic Neoplasms/*blood/*diagnosis; Prognosis; Protein Array Analysis/*methods; Young Adult",Liu F; Du F; Chen X,World journal of surgical oncology,2014,Nov,World J Surg Oncol. 2014 Nov 8;12:333. doi: 10.1186/1477-7819-12-333.,England,345,4233091
33269057,Endoscopic ultrasound-guided gallbladder drainage in pancreatic cancer and cholangitis: A case report.,"BACKGROUND: Head pancreatic cancers often present with clinical challenges requiring biliary drainage for chemotherapy or palliative scope. If usual endoscopic modalities fail or if percutaneous approach is not feasible, endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) guided biliary drainage can be considered. Here we describe and discuss an interesting clinical case in which EUS-guided gallbladder drainage (EUS-GBD) was chosen to treat acute severe cholangitis in a patient with advanced pancreatic cancer. CASE SUMMARY: An 84-year-old female with a previous EUS-biopsy proven diagnosis of head pancreatic cancer presented with clinical signs of acute cholangitis. In September 2018 she had positioned a biliary and duodenal stent to relieve jaundice and an initial duodenal substenosis. In the emergency ward, an abdominal computed tomography scan showed proximal biliary stent occlusion due to neoplastic progression, but endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was impossible because of worsening duodenal stenosis and the absence of a chance to reach the Vater's papilla area. EUS-guided choledocoduodenostomy was not technically feasible but because the cystic duct was free of neoplastic infiltration, an EUS-GBD using an Axios stent was successfully performed. The patient started to feed after 48 h and was discharged 1 wk later. No other hospitalizations due to cholangitis or symptoms of Axios stent occlusion/dysfunction were observed up until her death 6 mo later due to underlying disease. CONCLUSION: This case demonstrated how different EUS therapeutic approaches could have a key role to treat critical and seemingly unsolvable situations and that they could play a more fundamental role in the next future.",,de Nucci G; Imperatore N; Picascia D; Mandelli ED; Bezzio C; Arena I; Omazzi B; Larghi A; Manes G,World journal of gastrointestinal endoscopy,2020,Nov,World J Gastrointest Endosc. 2020 Nov 16;12(11):488-492. doi: 10.4253/wjge.v12.i11.488.,United States,310,7677881
38580394,Supplemental tube feeding: qualitative study of patient perspectives in advanced pancreatic cancer.,"OBJECTIVES: Malnutrition is associated with poor quality of life and survival outcomes for patients with cancer, but is challenging to prevent or treat in pancreatic cancer due to the multifactorial drivers of nutritional decline. A novel application of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy with a jejunal extension tube to deliver supplementary nutrition may improve outcomes, and will be tested in a randomised controlled trial. This study explored the perspectives of people living with pancreatic cancer regarding the acceptability of this proposed intensive nutrition intervention, to elucidate appropriateness and anticipated barriers, and facilitate informed design of the planned trial. METHODS: Participants were patients with pancreatic cancer previously enrolled in a Pancreaticobiliary Cancer Biobank. Qualitative semi-structured interviews were conducted by telephone and transcribed verbatim for deductive thematic analysis. The Framework Model was used, with the Theoretical Framework of Acceptability as the analytical framework. RESULTS: 10 participants were recruited. Four overarching themes were developed from interviews: (1) deterioration in physical and mental well-being are consequences of debilitating nutrition impact symptoms; (2) willingness to participate depends on an individual threshold for nutritional deterioration; (3) predicted perceived effectiveness outweighed anticipated burdens and (4) adequate dietetic support is needed for maintaining a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy with jejunal extension feeding tube at home with confidence. CONCLUSIONS: Most participants believed that the intervention would benefit people with advanced pancreatic cancer to maintain their nutrition throughout chemotherapy. Regular and ad hoc support was considered essential, and the degree of individual nutritional deterioration was identified as an important indicator for trial participation.","Humans; *Pancreatic Neoplasms/complications/psychology/therapy; Female; *Enteral Nutrition/methods/psychology; Male; Aged; Qualitative Research; Middle Aged; Quality of Life; *Malnutrition/etiology/therapy/prevention & control; *Gastrostomy/methods; Aged, 80 and over",Nguyen G; Furness K; Croagh D; Haines T; Hanna L,BMJ supportive & palliative care,2024,Dec,BMJ Support Palliat Care. 2024 Dec 19;14(e3):e3002-e3010. doi: 10.1136/spcare-2024-004836.,England,403,11671877
37133625,Characteristics of patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer who access palliative care: An observational study.,"PURPOSE: Despite the benefits of palliative care (PC) in pancreatic cancer, little is known about patients who access PC. This observational study examines the characteristics of patients with pancreatic cancer at their first episode of PC. METHODS: First-time, specialist PC episodes captured through the Palliative Care Outcomes Collaboration (PCOC), in Victoria, Australia between 2014 and 2020, for pancreatic cancer, were identified. Multivariable logistic regression analyses examined the impact of patient- and service-level characteristics on symptom burden (measured through patient-reported outcome measures and clinician-rated scores) at first PC episode. RESULTS: Of 2890 eligible episodes, 45% began when the patient was deteriorating and 32% ended in death. High fatigue and appetite-related distress were most common. Generally, increasing age, higher performance status and more recent year of diagnosis predicted lower symptom burden. No significant differences were noted between symptom burden of regional/remote versus major city dwellers; however, only 11% of episodes recorded the patient as a regional/remote resident. A greater proportion of first episodes for non-English-speaking patients began when the patient was unstable, deteriorating or terminal, ended in death and were more likely to be associated with high family/carer problems. Community PC setting predicted high symptom burden, with the exception of pain. CONCLUSION: A large proportion of first-time specialist PC episodes in pancreatic cancer begin at a deteriorating phase and end in death, suggesting late access to PC.

34853635,Inhibition of poly (ADP-Ribose) polymerase: A promising strategy targeting pancreatic cancer with BRCAness phenotype.,"The use of chemotherapeutic regimens for the treatment of pancreatic cancer is still limited because pancreatic cancer is usually diagnosed at an advanced stage as a refractory disease in which symptoms are difficult to recognize in the early stages. Furthermore, at advanced stages, there are important challenges to achieve clinical benefit and symptom resolution, even with the use of an expanded spectrum of anticancer drugs. Recently, a point of reduced susceptibility to conventional chemotherapies by breast cancer susceptibility gene (BRCA) mutations led to a new perspective for overcoming the resistance of pancreatic cancer within the framework of increased genome instability. Poly (ADP-Ribose) polymerase (PARP) -1 is an enzyme that can regulate intrinsic functions, such as response to DNA damage. Therefore, in an environment where germline mutations in BRCAs (BRCAness) inhibit homologous recombination in DNA damage, resulting in a lack of DNA damage response, a key role of PARP-1 for the adaptation of the genome instability could be further emphasized. Here, we summarized the key functional role of PARP-1 in genomic instability of pancreatic cancer with the BRCAness phenotype and listed clinical applications and outcomes of PARP-1 inhibitors to highlight the importance of targeting PARP-1 activity.",,Jeong KY; Lee H,World journal of gastrointestinal oncology,2021,Nov,World J Gastrointest Oncol. 2021 Nov 15;13(11):1544-1550. doi: 10.4251/wjgo.v13.i11.1544.,China,257,8603447

38136443,Effects of Exercise Training on Patient-Specific Outcomes in Pancreatic Cancer Patients: A Scoping Review.,"BACKGROUND: International guidelines have already highlighted the beneficial effects of exercise in common cancer entities. However, specific recommendations for pancreatic cancer are still missing. This scoping review aimed to evaluate the impact of exercise training on patient-specific outcomes in pancreatic cancer patients. METHODS: A literature search was undertaken using PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published before August 2023 with structured exercise interventions during or after pancreatic cancer treatment. RESULTS: Seven articles that prescribed home-based or supervised exercise with aerobic or resistance training or both were reviewed. The results indicate that exercise is feasible and safe in pancreatic cancer patients. Furthermore, exercise was associated with improved quality of life, cancer-related fatigue, and muscle strength. Concerning other outcomes, heterogeneous results were reported. We identified a lack of evidence, particularly for patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. CONCLUSION: Exercise interventions in pancreatic cancer patients are feasible and can lead to improved quality of life, cancer-related fatigue, and muscle strength. However, further studies with larger sample sizes are needed to clarify the potential of exercise in pancreatic cancer, in particular for advanced stages.",,Rosebrock K; Sinn M; Uzunoglu FG; Bokemeyer C; Jensen W; Salchow J,Cancers,2023,Dec,Cancers (Basel). 2023 Dec 18;15(24):5899. doi: 10.3390/cancers15245899.,Switzerland,437,10741570
26335014,SPARC: A Potential Prognostic and Therapeutic Target in Pancreatic Cancer.,"Pancreatic cancer is a complex and heterogeneous disease that often lacks disease-specific symptoms in early stages. The malignancy is currently the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death in Western countries. In advanced stages, the overall 5-year survival is less than 1% to 2%. Most available treatments lack convincing cost-efficiency determinations and are generally not associated with relevant success rates. Targeting stromal components and stromal depletion is currently becoming an area of extensive research in pancreatic cancer. In this context, a glycoprotein, SPARC (secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine) appears to play a central role. Still, the role of SPARC in carcinogenesis is controversial because conflicting results have been reported, and the pathways involved in SPARC signaling are not well established. Nonetheless, SPARC is highly expressed in the tumor stroma, principally in peritumoral fibroblasts, and the overexpression of SPARC in this compartment is associated with poorer prognosis. Interestingly, it has been suggested that SPARC present in the tumor stroma could sequester albumin-bound paclitaxel, enhancing the delivery of paclitaxel into the tumor microenvironment. In the present review, we summarize the known associations between SPARC and pancreatic cancer. Moreover, present and future therapies comprising SPARC-targeting are discussed.","Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/therapeutic use; Carcinoma, Pancreatic Ductal/diagnosis/*drug therapy/genetics; DNA Methylation; Deoxycytidine/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use; Humans; Osteonectin/*genetics/metabolism; Pancreatic Neoplasms/diagnosis/*drug therapy/genetics; Prognosis; Signal Transduction/*genetics; Treatment Outcome; Gemcitabine",Vaz J; Ansari D; Sasor A; Andersson R,Pancreas,2015,Oct,Pancreas. 2015 Oct;44(7):1024-35. doi: 10.1097/MPA.0000000000000409.,United States,491,4568900
29245220,"Case report of intestinal non-rotation, heterotaxy, and polysplenia in a patient with pancreatic cancer.","RATIONALE: Heterotaxy with polysplenia is an extremely rare congenital condition resulting from abnormal arrangement of organs in the abdominal and thoracic cavities during embryologic development. When a malignancy such as pancreatic cancer develops under these conditions, surgical resection becomes particularly complex. This case report demonstrates successful pancreatic cancer resection despite the patient's complicated anatomy. PATIENT CONCERNS: An 82-year-old female presented to our institution with complaints of mild right upper quadrant pain radiating to the mid-epigastric region. DIAGNOSES: Physical examination revealed jaundice with scleral icterus consistent with obstructive jaundice. Radiographic imaging revealed hepatic duct dilation with several anatomic anomalies including small bowel location in the right upper abdomen, cecum, and appendix in the left lower quadrant, reversed superior mesenteric artery and superior mesenteric vein positions, and right-sided duodenal-jejunal flexture as well as an entirely right-sided pancreas, and left lower pelvis with >/=6 separate splenules. These findings resulted in a diagnosis of heterotaxy syndrome with polysplenia. INTERVENTIONS: Careful preoperative planning and total pancreatectomy was performed without complication. OUTCOMES: The patient recovered well. Pathologic examination of the pancreatic mass revealed moderately/poorly differentiated invasive pancreatic duct adenocarcinoma. The patient remains alive and well without signs of recurrent disease at the 2-year follow-up. LESSONS: Given the wide range of anatomical variants observed in patients with heterotaxy syndrome, a thorough radiologic assessment is necessary before engaging in any surgical procedure. In our case, preoperative identification of the various anatomic anomalies, such as the short and vertically oriented pancreas, the porta hepatis position anterior to the duodenum, the nonrotation of the intestines and the anomalous origin of the right hepatic artery allowed us to perform a safe and uncomplicated total pancreatectomy.","Aged, 80 and over; Female; Heterotaxy Syndrome/*complications; Humans; Intestinal Volvulus/*complications; Pancreas/surgery; Pancreatectomy/*methods; Pancreatic Neoplasms/complications/*surgery; Spleen/*abnormalities",Pagkratis S; Kryeziu S; Lin M; Hoque S; Bucobo JC; Buscaglia JM; Georgakis GV; Sasson AR; Kim J,Medicine,2017,Dec,Medicine (Baltimore). 2017 Dec;96(49):e8599. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000008599.,United States,442,5728835
27708523,Role of methylphenidate in the treatment of fatigue in advanced pancreatic cancer population.,"BACKGROUND: Fatigue is a common but devastating symptom for advanced pancreatic cancer (APC) patients. To date, no proven treatment exists. Methylphenidate (MPH) showed inconsistent results in treating other cancer related fatigue. We performed a retrospective study to assess MPH in ameliorating fatigue in APC patients. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed our clinic APC patients' records who visited from 06/2011 - 11/2014. Fatigue was assessed by Visual Analog Fatigue Scale (VAFS) and classified as grade 1 (VAFS 1-3), grade 2 (VAFS 4-6) and grade 3 (VAFS 7-10) to correspond with CTCAE V4.0. MPH was dosed at 5 mg daily in the morning and was escalated to 10 mg after 2 weeks if needed. The primary endpoint was to assess the change of fatigue grade after 4 weeks of MPH. Secondary outcomes included MPH's effect on depression, anorexia, maintenance chemotherapy intensity and adverse effects. RESULTS: A total of 71 APC patients on concomitant chemotherapy were included, of whom 67% received doublet, 13% triplet, and 20% single-agent chemotherapy. Mean baseline VAFS was 7, which dropped to 4 after 4 weeks of MPH, 55% patients' fatigue score improved by 1 grade, 8% by 2 grades, 23% had fatigue resolved, 14% without benefit. 72% patients maintained chemotherapy intensity, 39% felt less depression and 52% had improved appetite. 13% stopped MPH due to side effects. Rare Grade 3 or 4 adverse events included insomnia, restlessness, palpitations and anorexia. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support low-dose MPH benefits APC patients with improved fatigue, depression and anorexia.

24345902,A proposed model for prediction of survival based on a follow-up study in unresectable pancreatic cancer.,"OBJECTIVES: To define an easy-to-use model for prediction of survival time in patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer in order to optimise patient' care. DESIGN: An observational retrospective study on patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer. The initial radiographs at presentation of symptoms were reviewed and the maximum diameter of the primary tumour was determined. The occurrence of liver metastases and performance status that determines initiation of chemotherapy was also used in the regression analysis to identify prognostic subgroups. SETTING: County hospital in south-east of Sweden. POPULATION: Consecutive patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer who were diagnosed between January 2003 and May 2010 (n=132). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Statistical analyses were performed using Stata V.13. Survival time was assessed with Kaplan-Meier analysis, log-rank test for equality of survivor functions and Cox regression for calculation of individual hazard based on tumour diameter, presence of liver metastases and initiation of chemotherapy treatment according to patient performance status. RESULTS: The individual hazard was log h=0.357 tumour size+1.181 liver metastases-0.989 performance status/chemotherapy. Three prognostic groups could be defined: a low-risk group with a median survival time of 6.7 (IQR 9.7) months, a medium-risk group with a median survival time of 4.5 (IQR 4.5) months and a high-risk group with a median survival time of 1.2 (IQR 1.7) months. CONCLUSIONS: The maximum diameter of the primary tumour and the presence of liver metastases found at the X-ray examination of patients with pancreatic cancer, in conjunction with whether or not chemotherapy is initiated according to performance status, predict the survival time for patients who do not undergo surgical resection. The findings result in an easy-to-use model for predicting the survival time.",,Forssell H; Wester M; Akesson K; Johansson S,BMJ open,2013,Dec,BMJ Open. 2013 Dec 17;3(12):e004064. doi: 10.1136/bmjopen-2013-004064.,England,409,3884621
36573015,The Role of Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells in the Treatment of Pancreatic Cancer.,"Pancreatic cancer has the highest mortality rate of all major cancers, with a 5-year survival rate of about 10%. Early warning signs and symptoms of pancreatic cancer are vague or nonexistent, and most patients are diagnosed in Stage IV, when surgery is not an option for about 80%-85% of patients. For patients with inoperable pancreatic cancer, current conventional treatment modalities such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy (RT) have suboptimal efficacy. Tumor progression is closely associated with the tumor microenvironment, which includes peripheral blood vessels, bone marrow-derived inflammatory cells, fibroblasts, immune cells, signaling molecules, and extracellular matrix. Tumor cells affect the microenvironment by releasing extracellular signaling molecules, inducing peripheral immune tolerance, and promoting tumor angiogenesis. In turn, the immune cells of the tumor affect the survival and proliferation of cancer cells. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells are key cellular components in the tumor microenvironment and exert immunosuppressive functions by producing cytokines, recognizing other immune cells, and promoting tumor growth and metastasis. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells are the main regulator of the tumor immune response and a key target for tumor treatments. Since the combination of RT and immunotherapy is the main strategy for the treatment of pancreatic cancer, it is very important to understand the immune mechanisms which lead to MDSCs generation and the failure of current therapies in order to develop new target-based therapies. This review summarizes the research advances on the role of Myeloid-derived suppressor cells in the progression of pancreatic cancer and its treatment application in recent years.",Humans; *Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells; *Neoplasms/pathology; *Pancreatic Neoplasms/therapy/pathology; Immunotherapy; Cytokines; Tumor Microenvironment,Dong P; Yan Y; Fan Y; Wang H; Wu D; Yang L; Zhang J; Yin X; Lv Y; Zhang J; Hou Y; Liu F; Yu X,Technology in cancer research & treatment,2022,Jan-Dec,Technol Cancer Res Treat. 2022 Jan-Dec;21:15330338221142472. doi: 10.1177/15330338221142472.,United States,371,9806441
31245024,Development of a psychoeducational intervention for people affected by pancreatic cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Pancreatic cancer has one of the highest mortality rates of any malignancy, placing a substantial burden on patients and families with high unmet informational and supportive care needs. Nevertheless, access to psychosocial and palliative care services for the individuals affected is limited. There is a need for standardized approaches to facilitate adjustment and to improve knowledge about the disease and its anticipated impact. In this intervention-development paper guided by implementation science principles, we report the rationale, methods, and processes employed in developing an interdisciplinary group psychoeducational intervention for people affected by pancreatic cancer. The acceptability and feasibility of implementation will be evaluated as a part of a subsequent feasibility study. METHODS: The Schofield and Chambers framework for designing sustainable self-management interventions in cancer care informed the development of the intervention content and format. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research served as an overarching guide of the implementation process, including the development phase and the formative evaluation plan of implementation. RESULTS: A representative team of stakeholders collaboratively developed and tailored the intervention content and format with attention to the principles of implementation science, including available resourcing. The final intervention prototype was designed as a single group-session led by an interdisciplinary clinical team with expertise in caring for patients with pancreatic cancer and their families and in addressing nutrition guidelines, disease and symptom management, communication with family and health care providers, family impact of cancer, preparing for the future, and palliative and supportive care services. CONCLUSIONS: The present paper describes the development of a group psychoeducational intervention to address the informational and supportive care needs of people affected by pancreatic cancer. Consideration of implementation science during intervention development efforts can optimize uptake and sustainability in the clinical setting. Our approach may be utilized as a framework for the design and implementation of similar initiatives to support people affected by diseases with limited prognoses.",,Tong E; Lo C; Moura S; Antes K; Buchanan S; Kamtapersaud V; Devins GM; Zimmermann C; Gallinger S; Rodin G,Pilot and feasibility studies,2019,,Pilot Feasibility Stud. 2019 Jun 20;5:80. doi: 10.1186/s40814-019-0466-x. eCollection 2019.,England,455,6584982
24549161,"""It can't be very important because it comes and goes""--patients' accounts of intermittent symptoms preceding a pancreatic cancer diagnosis: a qualitative study.","OBJECTIVE: This article explores how people with pancreatic cancer interpreted prediagnostic signs and symptoms, and what triggered them to seek medical help for symptoms that occurred intermittently. DESIGN: Thematic analysis of prediagnostic symptom descriptions drawn from a qualitative interview study of people with experiences of pancreatic cancer. PARTICIPANTS: 40 people affected by pancreatic cancer (32 patients and 8 relatives of people who had died). Age at interview ranged from 35 to 84 years; 55% were men; and 57.5% of patients had been offered potentially curative surgery. SETTING: Respondents interviewed at home were recruited from different parts of the UK during 2009/2010. RESULTS: Analysis of the interviews suggested that intermittent symptoms were not uncommon in the months, or even years, before diagnosis but that the fact that the symptom did not persist was often taken by the patient as a reassuring indicator that it could not be 'very important'. Such symptoms were rarely acted upon until a pattern became apparent, the frequency of symptom episodes increased, there was a change in the nature of the intermittent symptoms or additional symptom(s) appeared. These findings build on social science theories of consultation behaviour. CONCLUSIONS: Our study-the largest reported collection of qualitative interviews with people with pancreatic cancer-reports for the first time that symptoms of an intermittent nature may precede a pancreatic cancer diagnosis. Patients (and potentially their doctors as well) may be falsely reassured by symptoms that come and go. Pancreatic cancer might be identified at a stage where curative treatment is more likely if there were greater awareness that intermittent gastrointestinal symptoms can have a serious cause, and if patients with intermittent pancreatitis-like symptoms were investigated more readily.","Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Diagnosis, Differential; Female; Humans; Interviews as Topic; Male; Middle Aged; Pancreatic Neoplasms/*diagnosis/mortality; Qualitative Research; *Symptom Assessment; United Kingdom/epidemiology",Evans J; Chapple A; Salisbury H; Corrie P; Ziebland S,BMJ open,2014,Feb,BMJ Open. 2014 Feb 18;4(2):e004215. doi: 10.1136/bmjopen-2013-004215.,England,353,3932002
38927885,Extracellular Vesicular miRNA in Pancreatic Cancer: From Lab to Therapy.,"Pancreatic cancer is a prevalent lethal gastrointestinal cancer that generally does not show any symptoms until it reaches advanced stages, resulting in a high mortality rate. People at high risk, such as those with a family history or chronic pancreatitis, do not have a universally accepted screening protocol. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy demonstrate limited effectiveness in the management of pancreatic cancer, emphasizing the urgent need for innovative therapeutic strategies. Recent studies indicated that the complex interaction among pancreatic cancer cells within the dynamic microenvironment, comprising the extracellular matrix, cancer-associated cells, and diverse immune cells, intricately regulates the biological characteristics of the disease. Additionally, mounting evidence suggests that EVs play a crucial role as mediators in intercellular communication by the transportation of different biomolecules, such as miRNA, proteins, DNA, mRNA, and lipids, between heterogeneous cell subpopulations. This communication mediated by EVs significantly impacts multiple aspects of pancreatic cancer pathogenesis, including proliferation, angiogenesis, metastasis, and resistance to therapy. In this review, we delve into the pivotal role of EV-associated miRNAs in the progression, metastasis, and development of drug resistance in pancreatic cancer as well as their therapeutic potential as biomarkers and drug-delivery mechanisms for the management of pancreatic cancer.",,Tiwari PK; Shanmugam P; Karn V; Gupta S; Mishra R; Rustagi S; Chouhan M; Verma D; Jha NK; Kumar S,Cancers,2024,Jun,Cancers (Basel). 2024 Jun 8;16(12):2179. doi: 10.3390/cancers16122179.,Switzerland,518,11201547
40306989,Exploring the psychological burden in a pancreatic cancer surveillance programme based on high-risk individuals: a Swedish cross-sectional study.,"INTRODUCTION: Pancreatic cancer, an aggressive cancer that presents with few or unspecific symptoms, has a poor prognosis. Thus, diagnosis at an early stage is vital for survival and a chance for curative treatment. Therefore, surveillance programmes for high-risk individuals are of the utmost importance. However, data on the psychological burden among participants in these programmes are limited. AIMS: This study aimed to investigate the psychological burden for participants in a pancreatic cancer surveillance programme and explore whether the psychological burden was related to the individual's risk level for pancreatic cancer. METHODS: This single-centre cross-sectional study investigated cancer worry, anxiety, coping and perceived physical and mental health using a digital questionnaire, including the following instruments: Cancer Worry Scale (CWS), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), 13-Item Sense of Coherence and 12-Item Short-Form Survey. The invited participants (n=413) were healthy individuals with an increased risk of pancreatic cancer enrolled in a pancreatic cancer surveillance programme. RESULTS: The results indicated high cancer worry among respondents (n=78) with high scores on CWS (mean, 16.45). The majority (69.3%) had scores indicating high cancer worry (>/=14). Anxiety was not equally high among respondents (mean STAI-T, 35.13; STAI-S, 35.9). Female sex and younger age were significantly correlated with higher cancer worry and anxiety (p < 0.001). Outcomes in coping and perceived health were similar to those of the normal population. CONCLUSIONS: Cancer worry is particularly high among participants. No correlation was found between the risk level and psychological burden.","Humans; Cross-Sectional Studies; *Pancreatic Neoplasms/psychology/diagnosis; Female; Male; Middle Aged; Sweden/epidemiology; *Anxiety/epidemiology/psychology; Adaptation, Psychological; Aged; Surveys and Questionnaires; Adult; Cost of Illness; Risk Factors; Stress, Psychological; Mental Health",Vesterberg A; Asplund E; Marras G; Vujasinovic M; Haddad Ringborg C; Wengstrom Y; Lohr M,BMJ open,2025,Apr,BMJ Open. 2025 Apr 30;15(4):e097814. doi: 10.1136/bmjopen-2024-097814.,England,333,12049877
30925924,TAMing pancreatic cancer: combat with a double edged sword.,"Among all the deadly cancers, pancreatic cancer ranks seventh in mortality. The absence of any grave symptoms coupled with the unavailability of early prognostic and diagnostic markers make the disease incurable in most of the cases. This leads to a late diagnosis, where the disease would have aggravated and thus, incurable. Only around 20% of the cases present the early disease diagnosis. Surgical resection is the prime option available for curative local disease but in the case of advanced cancer, chemotherapy is the standard treatment modality although the patients end up with drug resistance and severe side effects. Desmoplasia plays a very important role in chemoresistance associated with pancreatic cancer and consists of a thick scar tissue around the tumor comprised of different cell populations. The interplay between this heterogenous population in the tumor microenvironment results in sustained tumor growth and metastasis. Accumulating evidences expose the crucial role played by the tumor-associated macrophages in pancreatic cancer and this review briefly presents the origin from their parent lineage and the importance in maintaining tumor hallmarks. Finally we have tried to address their role in imparting chemoresistance and the therapeutic interventions leading to reduced tumor burden.","Animals; Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use; *Drug Resistance, Neoplasm; Humans; Pancreatic Neoplasms/*diagnosis/*drug therapy; Prognosis; *Tumor Microenvironment",Lankadasari MB; Mukhopadhyay P; Mohammed S; Harikumar KB,Molecular cancer,2019,Mar,Mol Cancer. 2019 Mar 30;18(1):48. doi: 10.1186/s12943-019-0966-6.,England,637,6441154
39990013,End-of-life care for patients with pancreatic cancer in France: a nationwide population-based cohort study.,"BACKGROUND: Pancreatic cancer, a frequently fatal disease with severe symptoms, can require high-intensity end-of-life (HI-EOL) care, posing challenges to patients' well-being. The examination of HI-EOL care to develop tailored interventions in the management of pancreatic cancer is a critical, yet underexplored area. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to assess the factors that influence the intensity of end-of-life (EOL) care in France. DESIGN: A retrospective study of patients registered in the French Nationwide database who were hospitalized in France for pancreatic adenocarcinoma from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2019, and subsequently died during the follow-up period. METHODS: Data on patient demographics, clinical characteristics, hospitalization details, and palliative care were collected. The primary outcome measure was the evaluation of HI-EOL care, defined by indicators such as death in an intensive care unit (ICU), multiple hospitalizations, and chemotherapy administration within the last 30 days of life. Secondary outcomes included indicators of most-intensive EOL (MI-EOL) care and invasive procedures (IP). Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify factors associated with each outcome measure. RESULTS: A total of 42,696 patients who died from pancreatic adenocarcinoma were included. Among them, 41.1% experienced HI-EOL, with the most common indicators being multiple hospitalizations and death in an ICU, emergency room, or acute care unit. A smaller proportion (2.8%) received MI-EOL care, while 28.1% underwent IPs in the last 30 days of life. The multivariate analysis revealed that male gender and follow-up in non-cancer specialized care facilities were associated with a higher risk of HI-EOL. Conversely, palliative care involvement and older age at death were identified as protective factors. Male gender, older age at death, and palliative care involvement were associated with lower rates of MI-EOL care and IPs. CONCLUSION: These results underscore the importance of palliative care integration and individualized approaches in improving the EOL quality of care and patient outcomes for individuals with advanced pancreatic cancer.",,Marchese U; Pauly V; Pellat A; Richa Y; Fond G; Tzedakis S; Gaillard M; Fuchs B; Orleans V; Fuks D; El Amrani M; Boyer L,Therapeutic advances in medical oncology,2025,,Ther Adv Med Oncol. 2025 Feb 20;17:17588359251320731. doi: 10.1177/17588359251320731. eCollection 2025.,England,367,11843702
22617126,The risk of pancreatic cancer in symptomatic patients in primary care: a large case-control study using electronic records.,"BACKGROUND: Over 8000 new pancreatic cancers are diagnosed annually in the UK; most at an advanced stage, with only 3% 5-year survival. We aimed to identify and quantify the risk of pancreatic cancer for features in primary care. METHODS: A case-control study using electronic primary care records identified and quantified the features of pancreatic cancer. Cases, aged >/=40 in the General Practice Research Database, UK, with primary pancreatic cancer were matched with controls on age, sex and practice. Putative features of pancreatic cancer were identified in the year before diagnosis. Odds ratios (OR) were calculated for features of cancer using conditional logistic regression. Positive predictive values (PPV) were calculated for consulting patients. RESULTS: In all, 3635 cases and 16,459 controls were studied. Nine features were associated with pancreatic cancer (all P<0.001 except for back pain, P=0.004); jaundice, OR 1000 (95% confidence interval (CI) 4,302,500); abdominal pain, 5 (4.4, 5.6); nausea/vomiting, 4.5 (3.5, 5.7); back pain, 1.4 (1.1, 1.7); constipation, 2.2 (1.7, 2.8); diarrhoea, 1.9 (1.5, 2.5); weight loss, 15 (11, 22); malaise, 2.4 (1.6, 3.5); new-onset diabetes 2.1 (1.7, 2.5). Positive predictive values for patients aged >/=60 were <1%, apart from jaundice at 22% (95% CI 14, 52), though several pairs of symptoms had PPVs >1%. CONCLUSION: Most previously reported symptoms of pancreatic cancer were also relevant in primary care. Although predictive values were small - apart from jaundice - they provide a basis for selection of patients for investigation, especially with multiple symptoms.","Abdominal Pain/etiology; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Back Pain/etiology; Case-Control Studies; Constipation/etiology; Databases as Topic; Diarrhea/etiology; Female; Humans; Jaundice/etiology; Male; Middle Aged; Nausea; Pancreatic Neoplasms/*diagnosis; Primary Health Care; Risk; Vomiting; Weight Loss",Stapley S; Peters TJ; Neal RD; Rose PW; Walter FM; Hamilton W,British journal of cancer,2012,Jun,Br J Cancer. 2012 Jun 5;106(12):1940-4. doi: 10.1038/bjc.2012.190.

28871013,Understanding symptom appraisal and help-seeking in people with symptoms suggestive of pancreatic cancer: a qualitative study.,"OBJECTIVE: Pancreatic cancer has poor survival rates due to non-specific symptoms leading to later diagnosis. Understanding how patients interpret their symptoms could inform approaches to earlier diagnosis. This study sought to explore symptom appraisal and help-seeking among patients referred to secondary care for symptoms suggestive of pancreatic cancer. DESIGN: Qualitative analysis of semistructured in-depth interviews. Data were analysed iteratively and thematically, informed by the Model of Pathways to Treatment. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Pancreatic cancer occurs rarely in younger adults, therefore patients aged >/=40 years were recruited from nine hospitals after being referred to hospital with symptoms suggestive of pancreatic cancer; all were participants in a cohort study. Interviews were conducted soon after referral, and where possible, before diagnosis. RESULTS: Twenty-six interviews were conducted (cancer n=13 (pancreas n=9, other intra-abdominal n=4), non-cancer conditions n=13; age range 48-84 years; 14 women). Time from first symptoms to first presentation to healthcare ranged from 1 day to 270 days, median 21 days. We identified three main themes. Initial symptom appraisal usually began with intermittent, non-specific symptoms such as tiredness or appetite changes, attributed to diet and lifestyle, existing gastrointestinal conditions or side effects of medication. Responses to initial symptom appraisal included changes in meal type or frequency, or self-medication. Symptom changes such as alterations in appetite and enjoyment of food or weight loss usually prompted further appraisal. Triggers to seek help included a change or worsening of symptoms, particularly pain, which was often a 'tipping point'. Help-seeking was often encouraged by others. We found no differences in symptom appraisal and help-seeking between people diagnosed with cancer and those with other conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Greater public and healthcare professional awareness of the combinations of subtle and intermittent symptoms, and their evolving nature, is needed to prompt timelier help-seeking and investigation among people with symptoms of pancreatic cancer.","Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Delayed Diagnosis/*prevention & control; England; Female; *Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Interviews as Topic; Male; Medical History Taking; Middle Aged; Models, Theoretical; Pancreatic Neoplasms/*diagnosis; *Patient Acceptance of Health Care; Prospective Studies; Qualitative Research",Mills K; Birt L; Emery JD; Hall N; Banks J; Johnson M; Lancaster J; Hamilton W; Rubin GP; Walter FM,BMJ open,2017,Sep,BMJ Open. 2017 Sep 3;7(9):e015682. doi: 10.1136/bmjopen-2016-015682.,England,327,5588944
37743482,The pyrazole derivative of usnic acid inhibits the proliferation of pancreatic cancer cells in vitro and in vivo.,"BACKGROUND: Pancreatic cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer death in Western societies. Its late diagnosis and resistance to chemotherapies result in a high mortality rate; thus, the development of more effective therapies for the treatment of pancreatic cancer is strongly warranted. Usnic acid (UA) is a secondary metabolite of lichens that shows modest antiproliferative activity toward cancer cells. Recently, we reported the synthesis of a UA pyrazole derivative, named 5, which was more active than the parent compound toward cervical cancer cells. Here, its anticancer potential has been evaluated in detail in other cancer cells, particularly pancreatic cancer cells. METHODS: The impact of UA and derivative 5 on cell viability, morphology, cell cycle, and death was assessed using the MTT test, electron microscopy, flow cytometry, and immunoblotting, respectively. The calcium ions level was detected fluorometrically. In vivo, the anticancer activity of 5 was evaluated in a murine xenograft model. RESULTS: Derivative 5 inhibited the viability of different cancer cells. Noncancerous cells were less sensitive. It induced the release of calcium ions from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and ER stress, which was manifested by cell vacuolization. It was accompanied by G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and cell death of pancreatic cancer cells. When applied to nude mice with xenografted pancreatic cancer cells, 5 inhibited tumor growth, with no signs of kidney or liver toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: UA derivative 5 is superior to UA inhibiting the growth and proliferation of pancreatic cancer cells. ER stress exaggeration is a mechanism underlying the activity of derivative 5.",,Gimla M; Pyrczak-Felczykowska A; Malinowska M; Hac A; Narajczyk M; Bylinska I; Reekie TA; Herman-Antosiewicz A,Cancer cell international,2023,Sep,Cancer Cell Int. 2023 Sep 24;23(1):210. doi: 10.1186/s12935-023-03054-x.,England,340,10518105
38482250,Inhibition of GABAergic neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus precipitates visceral pain induced by pancreatic cancer in mice.,"BACKGROUND: For patients with pancreatic cancer, visceral pain is a debilitating symptom that significantly compromises their quality of life. Unfortunately, the lack of effective treatment options can be attributed to our limited understanding of the neural circuitry underlying this phenomenon. The primary objective of this study is to elucidate the fundamental mechanisms governing visceral pain induced by pancreatic cancer in murine models. METHODS: A mouse model of pancreatic cancer visceral pain was established in C57BL/6N mice through the intrapancreatic injection of mPA(KPC)-luc cells. Abdominal mechanical hyperalgesia and hunch score were employed to evaluate visceral pain, whereas the in vitro electrophysiological patch-clamp technique was utilized to record the electrophysiological activity of GABAergic neurons. Specific neuron ablation and chemogenetics methods were employed to investigate the involvement of GABAergic neurons in pancreatic cancer-induced visceral pain. RESULTS: In vitro electrophysiological results showed that the firing frequency of GABAergic neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) was decreased. Specific destruction of GABAergic neurons in the PVN exacerbated visceral pain induced by pancreatic cancer. Chemogenetics activation of GABAergic neurons in the PVN alleviated visceral pain induced by pancreatic cancer. CONCLUSIONS: GABAergic neurons located in PVN play a crucial role in precipitating visceral pain induced by pancreatic cancer in mice, thereby offering novel insights for identifying effective targets to treat pancreatic cancer-related visceral pain.",,Ji NN; Li ZY; Cao S; Pei B; Jin CY; Li YF; Mao P; Jiang H; Fan BF; Xia M,Journal of gastrointestinal oncology,2024,Feb,J Gastrointest Oncol. 2024 Feb 29;15(1):458-467. doi: 10.21037/jgo-24-50.

40234313,Supportive Care Needs and Related Interventions in Patients with Pancreatic Cancer and Their Informal Caregivers: A Scoping Review.,"PURPOSE: This scoping review aims to provide a comprehensive literature review regarding supportive care needs and related interventions for patients with pancreatic cancer and/or their informal caregivers. METHODS: Following the Joanna Briggs Institute Manual for Evidence Synthesis, we conducted this review. In January 2025, we searched five English databases using the keywords ""pancreatic cancer,"" ""patients/caregivers,"" ""supportive care,"" and ""needs."" We summarized the data employing the Supportive Care Framework. RESULTS: Of the 4752 references identified, 43 articles were included in the review. Among the 33 descriptive studies, informational needs emerged as the most frequently reported supportive care need, identified in studies involving both patients and informal caregivers (n = 6), patients only (n = 13), and informal caregivers only (n = 5). These were followed by emotional needs (n = 4) for both patients and informal caregivers, physical needs (n = 8) for patients only, and emotional (n = 4) and practical needs (n = 4) for informal caregivers only. Psycho-educational interventions were the most frequently reported approach for addressing the needs of both patients and informal caregivers, while pain/symptom management interventions were the most frequently used to support patients alone. Four studies demonstrated statistically significant improvements in outcomes for intervention groups compared to control groups. CONCLUSION: Patients with pancreatic cancer and their informal caregivers experienced a spectrum of supportive care needs, particularly informational needs. Intervention strategies have been developed to address their supportive care needs, but only a few studies demonstrated statistically significant improvements in outcomes. These findings advance our understanding of the supportive care needs and related interventions for patients with pancreatic cancer and/or their informal caregivers, providing a foundation for future research and targeted interventions to better address these needs.",Humans; *Pancreatic Neoplasms/psychology/therapy; *Caregivers/psychology; Social Support; *Health Services Needs and Demand; Needs Assessment,Fu L; Kim SH; Garcia DD; Lambert M; Rivera LR; Hayward M; Vieira C; Parikh A; Yu P; Song L,Journal of gastrointestinal cancer,2025,Apr,J Gastrointest Cancer. 2025 Apr 16;56(1):98. doi: 10.1007/s12029-025-01218-8.,United States,355,12000257
37737888,Endoscopic workup in pancreatic cancer.,"Pancreatic cancer is a highly lethal disease with a rising incidence. It is projected to become the second-leading cause of cancer-related mortality by 2030. The staging of pancreatic cancer can be broadly categorized into three groups: resectable cancers, locally advanced or borderline resectable cancers, and metastatic cancers. Endoscopy plays a crucial role in the management of pancreatic cancer for the establishment of the diagnosis, for the palliation of symptoms due to biliary and/or gastric outlet obstructions, and more recently, for the palliative ablation of cancer. The objective of this review is to provide an overview of the endoscopic evaluation and management of patients with pancreatic cancer. It will specifically cover the diagnostic approach utilizing endoscopic ultrasound, palliative interventions such as endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, and the emerging field of tumor debulking through radiofrequency ablation.","Humans; *Pancreatic Neoplasms/diagnosis/pathology/surgery; *Endosonography; Palliative Care/methods; Cholangiopancreatography, Endoscopic Retrograde/methods",Valente R; Coppola A; Scandavini CM; Arnelo U,"International journal of surgery (London, England)",2024,Oct,Int J Surg. 2024 Oct 1;110(10):6064-6069. doi: 10.1097/JS9.0000000000000777.,United States,291,11487006
31569661,CT- and MRI-Based Assessment of Body Composition and Pancreatic Fibrosis Reveals High Incidence of Clinically Significant Metabolic Changes That Affect the Quality of Life and Treatment Outcomes of Patients with Chronic Pancreatitis and Pancreatic Cancer.,"Background and Objectives: Both chronic pancreatitis (CP) and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) may lead to cachexia, sarcopenia, and osteoporosis due to different mechanisms. Neither patient gender, age, nor body weight are good predictors of these metabolic changes having a significant negative impact on the quality of life (QOL) and treatment outcomes. The aim of this study was to evaluate radiological changes in body composition and to compare them with manifestations of exocrine and endocrine pancreatic insufficiency, body mass, and QOL among patients with CP and PDAC. Materials and Methods: Prospectively collected data of 100 patients with diagnosed CP or PDAC were used for analysis. All patients underwent dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-C30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) was used to assess QOL. Diabetes and changes in fecal elastase-1 were also assessed. Results: There was no significant difference in skeletal muscle mass (SMM) among patients with CP and PDAC (p = 0.85). Significantly more underweight patients had low SMM (p = 0.002). Patients with CP had more pronounced pancreatic fibrosis (PF) (p < 0.001). Data showed a significant relationship between a high degree of PF and occurrence of diabetes (p = 0.006) and low fecal elastase-1 levels (p = 0.013). A statistically significant lower QOL was determined in patients with PF >/= 50% and in the CP group. Conclusions: Sarcopenia and osteoporosis/osteopenia are highly prevalent among patients with chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer, and CT- and MRI-based assessment of body composition and pancreatic fibrosis could be a potentially useful tool for routine detection of these significant metabolic changes.","Adenocarcinoma/complications/*metabolism; Adult; Aged; Body Composition; Female; Fibrosis/diagnostic imaging/*metabolism; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Muscle, Skeletal/pathology; Osteoporosis/diagnosis/etiology/metabolism; Pancreatic Neoplasms/complications/*metabolism; Pancreatitis, Chronic/complications/*metabolism; Prospective Studies; Quality of Life; Sarcopenia/diagnosis/etiology/metabolism; Surveys and Questionnaires; Tomography, X-Ray Computed",Bieliuniene E; Brondum Frokjaer J; Pockevicius A; Kemesiene J; Lukosevicius S; Basevicius A; Atstupenaite V; Barauskas G; Ignatavicius P; Gulbinas A; Dambrauskas Z,"Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)",2019,Sep,Medicina (Kaunas). 2019 Sep 27;55(10):649. doi: 10.3390/medicina55100649.,Switzerland,610,6843405
36059331,A Rare Case of Brain Metastases in an Elderly Patient With Primary Pancreatic Cancer.,"Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is an extremely aggressive cancer with a low survival rate. Common sites for metastases include the liver and lungs, while brain metastases are considered extremely rare, especially in elderly patients. We present an elderly female patient who developed brain metastases 51 months after the initial diagnosis of pancreatic cancer and was treated with gross tumor resection, chemotherapy, and stereotactic radiosurgery. The treatment completely resolved her neurological symptoms but did not result in improved survival for this patient. The patient developed generalized tonic-clonic seizures, was diagnosed with leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, and died 5.5 months after tumor resection. The literature on pancreatic cancer with brain metastases is scarce, with limited guidelines for treatment strategies in this patient population.

30567565,Pancreatic cancer associated with obesity and diabetes: an alternative approach for its targeting.,"BACKGROUND: Pancreatic cancer (PC) is among foremost causes of cancer related deaths worldwide due to generic symptoms, lack of effective screening strategies and resistance to chemo- and radiotherapies. The risk factors associated with PC include several metabolic disorders such as obesity, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Studies have shown that obesity and T2DM are associated with PC pathogenesis; however, their role in PC initiation and development remains obscure. MAIN BODY: Several biochemical and physiological factors associated with obesity and/or T2DM including adipokines, inflammatory mediators, and altered microbiome are involved in PC progression and metastasis albeit by different molecular mechanisms. Deep understanding of these factors and causal relationship between factors and altered signaling pathways will facilitate deconvolution of disease complexity as well as lead to development of novel therapies. In the present review, we focuses on the interplay between adipocytokines, gut microbiota, adrenomedullin, hyaluronan, vanin and matrix metalloproteinase affected by metabolic alteration and pancreatic tumor progression. CONCLUSIONS: Metabolic diseases, such as obesity and T2DM, contribute PC development through altered metabolic pathways. Delineating key players in oncogenic development in pancreas due to metabolic disorder could be a beneficial strategy to combat cancers associated with metabolic diseases in particular, PC.","Animals; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*complications/pathology; Humans; Obesity/*complications/pathology; Pancreatic Neoplasms/*etiology/pathology; Risk Factors",Pothuraju R; Rachagani S; Junker WM; Chaudhary S; Saraswathi V; Kaur S; Batra SK,Journal of experimental & clinical cancer research : CR,2018,Dec,J Exp Clin Cancer Res. 2018 Dec 19;37(1):319. doi: 10.1186/s13046-018-0963-4.,England,363,6299603
39310415,Treatment and Prognosis for Pancreatic Duct Disruption Associated With Pancreatic Cancer: A Case Series of 15 Patients.,"Background Pancreatic duct (PD) disruption can occasionally be attributed to pancreatic cancer. Therapeutic interventions for PD disruption due to pancreatic cancer and their influence on pancreatic cancer prognosis remain unclear. This study investigated the therapeutic modalities and prognostic implications of PD disruption in pancreatic cancer. Methods This retrospective study included 15 patients with PD disruption concomitant with pancreatic cancer between April 2011 and March 2023. As an endoscopic intervention for PD disruption, endoscopic pancreatic stenting (EPS) or endoscopic ultrasonography-guided pancreatic fluid collection drainage (EUS-PFD) was performed. Technical success was defined as stent placement and clinical success was defined as an improvement in PD disruption. Results Of the 15 cases of PD disruption, two involved only pancreatic juice leakage without symptoms, four involved pancreatic pseudocyst (PPC) without infection, and nine involved PPC with infection. Four patients underwent EPS, nine underwent EUS-PFD, and two underwent lumen-apposing metal stent placement. All patients achieved both technical and clinical success without complications. The clinical stage of pancreatic cancer ranged from carcinoma in situ to the metastatic phase. For the treatment of pancreatic cancer, five patients underwent surgical resection, and eight underwent chemotherapy. There was no obvious recurrence of peritoneal sowing. The median overall survival from the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer in the resected and non-resected cases was 74 and 9.6 months, respectively. Conclusion Endoscopic intervention was effective in all cases of PD disruption due to pancreatic cancer. Furthermore, even in cases of pancreatic cancer after PD disruption, survival rates were similar to those in cases without PD disruption and were achieved through surgical resection or chemotherapy.",,Oka Y; Tanaka T; Kobayashi T; Masuda A; Sakai A; Tsujimae M; Gonda M; Toyama H; Fukumoto T; Kodama Y,Cureus,2024,Aug,Cureus. 2024 Aug 22;16(8):e67482. doi: 10.7759/cureus.67482. eCollection 2024 Aug.,United States,350,11416195
29381963,Apatinib concurrent gemcitabine for controlling malignant ascites in advanced pancreatic cancer patient: A case report.,"RATIONALE: Malignant ascites (MA) is one of the poor prognostic factors for advanced pancreatic cancer and can bring about serious symptoms. The improvement of quality of life for patients is priority. However, there is no standard method for the treatment for pancreatic cancer-mediated MA. Apatinib is a novel and highly selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2. There are no reports of concurrent apatinib with gemcitabine in patients with pancreatic cancer-mediated MA. PATIENT CONCERNS: Herein, we presented a 64-year-old man patient who visited hospital due to abdominal pain for 1 month. DIAGNOSES: He was initially diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and his first symptom was MA. INTERVENTIONS: After failing in tube drainage and gemcitabine therapy, the patient received gemcitabine combined apatinib orally and after administrated 1 month, the MA was evaluated as nearly clear response according to the RECIST 1.1 standard, and without further need of paracentesis. The CEA and CA199 reached the lowest level after administrating for 2.5 months during the treatment process. OUTCOMES: 10.5 months following apatinib administration, the patient achieved a progression-free survival for more than 11 months. Hypertension (grade IV), hand-foot syndrome (grade I) and proteinuria (grade II) were observed. LESSONS: It indicated that apatinib concurrent gemcitabine may be a superior choice for pancreatic cancer-mediated MA.

34026217,Endoscopic pancreatic duct stenting for pain palliation in selected pancreatic cancer patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Abdominal pain is a debilitating symptom affecting  approximately 80% of pancreatic cancer (PC) patients. Pancreatic duct (PD) decompression has been reported to alleviate this pain, although this practice has not been widely adopted. We aimed to evaluate the role, efficacy, and safety of endoscopic PD decompression for palliation of PC post-prandial obstructive-type pain. METHODS: A systematic review until 7 October 2020 was performed. Two independent reviewers selected studies, extracted data, and assessed the methodological quality. RESULTS: We identified 12 publications with a total of 192 patients with PC presenting with abdominal pain, in whom PD decompression was attempted, and was successful in 167 patients (mean age 62.5 years, 58.7% males). The use of plastic stents was reported in 159 patients (95.2%). All included studies reported partial or complete improvement in pain levels after PD stenting, with an improvement rate of 93% (95% confidence interval, 79%-100%). The mean duration of pain improvement was 94 +/- 16 days. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)-related adverse events (AEs) were post-sphincterotomy bleeding (1.8%), post-ERCP pancreatitis (0.6%), and hemosuccus pancreaticus (0.6%). AEs were not reported in two patients who underwent endoscopic ultrasound-guided PD decompression. In the 167 patients with technical success, the stent-migration and stent-occlusion rates were 3.6% and 3.0%, respectively. No AE-related mortality was reported. The methodological quality assessment showed the majority of the studies having low or unclear quality. CONCLUSION: In this exploratory analysis, endoscopic PD drainage may be an effective and safe option in selected patients for the management of obstructive-type PC pain.

25126577,MicroRNA expression in salivary supernatant of patients with pancreatic cancer and its relationship with ZHENG.,"In traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), diagnosis and prescriptions are based on the signs and symptoms which are recognized as ZHENG. The cornerstone of TCM is to differentially treat one ZHENG from others, which is also known as syndrome differentiation, and this relies on the gathering of clinical information through inspection, auscultation and olfaction, inquiry, and palpation. However, the biomolecular basis of the ZHENG remains unclear. In this study, the expressions of 384 cancer-related miRNAs in salivary supernatant of patients with pancreatic cancer were assessed by miRNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) array, and the different expression patterns of miRNA in three different groups of ZHENG were studied with use of real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR). Some miRNAs were found to be specifically expressed in some ZHENGs, for instance, miR-17, miR-21, and miR-181b in Shi-Re ZHENG and miR-196a in Pi-Xu ZHENG. This indicates that these miRNAs may play important roles in different ZHENG condition. Therefore, this study to some extent revealed the molecular basis of TCM ZHENG in pancreatic cancer.","Adult; Aged; Female; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; Male; *Medicine, Chinese Traditional; MicroRNAs/*biosynthesis; Middle Aged; Pancreatic Neoplasms/diagnosis/*genetics/pathology; Salivary Proteins and Peptides/*biosynthesis",Gao S; Chen LY; Wang P; Liu LM; Chen Z,BioMed research international,2014,,Biomed Res Int. 2014;2014:756347. doi: 10.1155/2014/756347.

29606890,L61H46 shows potent efficacy against human pancreatic cancer through inhibiting STAT3 pathway.,"BACKGROUND: Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. The poor prognosis of this disease highlights the urgent need to develop more effective therapies. Activation of the STAT3 represents a potential drug target for pancreatic cancer therapy. Currently, clinically available small-molecule inhibitors targeting STAT3 are lacking. METHODS: Through bioassay screening and molecular docking, we identified a small molecule L61H46 that can potently target constitutive STAT3 signaling and kill human pancreatic cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS: L61H46 effectively reduced colony formation and the viability of pancreatic cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner with half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) values in the range between 0.86 and 2.83 microM. L61H46 significantly inhibited STAT3 phosphorylation (Tyr705) and the subsequent nucleus translocation but did not downregulate STAT1 phosphorylation. Moreover, L61H46 demonstrated a potent activity in suppressing pancreatic tumor growth in BXPC-3 xenograft model in vivo. Furthermore, L61H46 showed no signs of adverse effects on liver, heart, and kidney cells in vivo. CONCLUSION: Collectively, our results suggest that L61H46 could be further optimized into a highly potent STAT3 inhibitor for the treatment of pancreatic cancer.",,Bai E; Yang L; Xiang Y; Hu W; Li C; Lin J; Dai X; Liang G; Jin R; Zhao C,Cancer management and research,2018,,Cancer Manag Res. 2018 Mar 23;10:565-581. doi: 10.2147/CMAR.S159090. eCollection 2018.,New Zealand,250,5868586
31867446,Possible involvement of HSP70 in pancreatic cancer cell proliferation after heat exposure and impact on RFA postoperative patient prognosis.,"PURPOSE: As an alleviative treatment measured in patients with unresectable advanced pancreatic cancer, radiofrequency ablation (RFA) needed more clinical data to prove its advantages and to explore limitations in its utilization. This study was determined to observe the efficacy of RFA, and to explore its impact on perioperative periphery carcinoma as well as the normal pancreatic tissues. METHODS: Clinical data of 32 patients with pancreatic cancer accepted RFA surgery were collected. Followed up patients' pain degree and the changes in serum tumor markers CA19-9 and CA 242 before and after surgery. Ex vivo, gave human pancreatic cancer cell line PANC-1 heat treatment to simulate the heat exposure condition periphery carcinoma was experienced during RFA surgery, and to observe the proliferation rate and HSP70 expression change compared with control group. RESULTS: Of the 32 patients, 1 died of upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage, and 29 survived for more than 5 months, 2 of which for more than 16 months. The average CA19-9 and CA 242 levels of the patients were significantly decreased in 3 months after surgery (t = 9.873, 5.978, P < 0.001). During in vitro experiments, the proliferation rate of PANC-1 cells after heating was significantly increased, accompanied with the increased HSP70 expression. The addition of HSP70 inhibitor can inhibit the rise of proliferation after heat therapy. CONCLUSION: Utilizing RFA treat patients with unresectable advanced pancreatic cancer, could effectively relieve the pain, decline jaundice, and deduce tumor marker levels significantly. However, it failed to extend the long-term survival rate of the patients significantly. This study found that a higher proliferative rate accompanied with a higher HSP70 expression level were observed on in vitro cultured pancreatic carcinoma cells after heat treatment, which could be altered by HSP70 inhibitor. And these findings indicated that the heat exposure might impact periphery carcinoma during RFA surgery and HSP70 might play an important role in patients' prognosis.",,Song HB,Biochemistry and biophysics reports,2019,Dec,Biochem Biophys Rep. 2019 Oct 31;20:100700. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrep.2019.100700. eCollection 2019 Dec.,Netherlands,430,6895569
32194490,PREPARE: PreoPerative Anxiety REduction. One-Year Feasibility RCT on a Brief Psychological Intervention for Pancreatic Cancer Patients Prior to Major Surgery.,"INTRODUCTION: The aim of the present paper is to establish feasibility and required power of a one-session psychological intervention devoted to increasing patient's self-efficacy and awareness in dealing with anxiety symptoms before major pancreatic cancer surgery. METHODS: Parallel assignment RCT. All consenting patients listed for pancreatic major surgery during day-hospital visits (T0) between June 2017-June 2018 were assigned randomly in blocks of ten to a psychological intervention vs usual care group to be held the day before surgery (T1). The psychological intervention provided the patient the opportunity to increase self-efficacy in dealing with anxiety by talking with a psychologist about personal concerns and learning mindfulness based techniques to cope with anxiety. RESULTS: 400 patients were randomized into the experimental vs. usual care group. 49 and 65, respectively, completed baseline and post-intervention measures. The dropout rate between day-hospital (T0) and pre-surgery intervention (T1) was high (74.5%) due to several management and organization pitfalls. The main outcome, perceived self-efficacy in managing anxiety, showed a significant increase in the intervention group compared to the control group (p < 0.001), and was related to a reduction in state anxiety (p < 0.001). The intervention group perceived also lower emotional pain (p = 0.03). A power analysis was performed to define the appropriate sample size in a definitive RCT. CONCLUSION: Beneath the complexity in retaining patients along their trajectory in pancreatic surgery department, when they had the opportunity to follow a brief psychological intervention, most of them adhered, showing a significant reduction in preoperative emotional distress and less emotional pain perception after surgery. Even if results need caution because of the high attrition rate, we can infer that our psychological intervention has the potential to be proposed in surgical setting, being short, easy to learn and applicable to a wide range of patients.

26530749,"Health-Related Quality of Life in SCALOP, a Randomized Phase 2 Trial Comparing Chemoradiation Therapy Regimens in Locally Advanced Pancreatic Cancer.","PURPOSE: Chemoradiation therapy (CRT) for patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC) provides survival benefits but may result in considerable toxicity. Health-related quality of life (HRQL) measurements during CRT have not been widely reported. This paper reports HRQL data from the Selective Chemoradiation in Advanced Localised Pancreatic Cancer (SCALOP) trial, including validation of the QLQ-PAN26 tool in CRT. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients with locally advanced, inoperable, nonmetastatic carcinoma of the pancreas were eligible. Following 12 weeks of induction gemcitabine plus capecitabine (GEMCAP) chemotherapy, patients with stable and responding disease were randomized to a further cycle of GEMCAP followed by capecitabine- or gemcitabine-based CRT. HRQL was assessed with the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) and the EORTC Pancreatic Cancer module (PAN26). RESULTS: A total of 114 patients from 28 UK centers were registered and 74 patients randomized. There was improvement in the majority of HRQL scales during induction chemotherapy. Patients with significant deterioration in fatigue, appetite loss, and gastrointestinal symptoms during CRT recovered within 3 weeks following CRT. Differences in changes in HRQL scores between trial arms rarely reached statistical significance; however, where they did, they favored capecitabine therapy. PAN26 scales had good internal consistency and were able to distinguish between subgroups of patients experiencing toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: Although there is deterioration in HRQL following CRT, this resolves within 3 weeks. HRQL data support the use of capecitabine- over gemcitabine-based chemoradiation. The QLQ-PAN26 is a reliable and valid tool for use in patients receiving CRT.","Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use; Capecitabine/administration & dosage; Chemoradiotherapy/adverse effects/*methods; Deoxycytidine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives; Drug Administration Schedule; Fatigue/etiology; Feeding and Eating Disorders/etiology; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Gastrointestinal Diseases/etiology; *Health Status; Humans; Induction Chemotherapy/adverse effects/methods; Male; Pancreatic Neoplasms/*pathology/*therapy; *Quality of Life; Statistics, Nonparametric; Surveys and Questionnaires; United Kingdom; Gemcitabine",Hurt CN; Mukherjee S; Bridgewater J; Falk S; Crosby T; McDonald A; Joseph G; Staffurth J; Abrams RA; Blazeby JM; Bridges S; Dutton P; Griffiths G; Maughan T; Johnson C,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",2015,Nov,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2015 Nov 15;93(4):810-8. doi: 10.1016/j.ijrobp.2015.08.026.

39279197,Focal Autoimmune Pancreatitis Morphologically Mimicking Pancreatic Cancer: A Case Report and Literature Review.,"BACKGROUND Autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP) is identified as an outlier in the clinical practice of chronic pancreatitis caused by autoimmune system dysfunction. AIP is classified into 3 subtypes: AIP type 1 and AIP type 2, which are both sensitive to corticosteroids, and the recently introduced AIP type 3. CASE REPORT We present a case of a patient who presented with painless obstructive jaundice. Computed tomography (CT) revealed hyperdense gallbladder material, further dilatation of intrahepatic bile ducts, and distention of the bile duct (15 mm). Based on the available clinical data, which were strongly compatible with pancreatic cancer, Whipple surgery was selected as the treatment for this case. The consequent histopathological report revealed areas of pancreatic parenchyma with fibrous connective tissue development and dense inflammatory cell infiltration with lymphocytes and plasmacytes, which showcased IgG4 positivity. The clinical results suggested a diagnosis of AIP type 1, and the patient was referred to his treating physician for further treatment of AIP. Preoperative histological examination of the pancreas, along with evaluation of the radiological and serological features, could have aided in determining the diagnosis of AIP type 1 pancreatitis despite the unique abnormality of this particular case. CONCLUSIONS Given the aforementioned conditions, AIP, even as a rare clinical entity, emerges as a canonical ailment and should be considered a viable possibility in clinical practice since it can exclude the patient from an unnecessary surgery.","Humans; *Autoimmune Pancreatitis/diagnosis; Diagnosis, Differential; *Pancreatic Neoplasms/diagnosis/pathology; Tomography, X-Ray Computed",Paramythiotis D; Karlafti E; Siniosoglou K; Tsavdaris D; Abba Deka I; Raptou G; Mavropoulou XG; Psoma E; Panidis S; Michalopoulos A,The American journal of case reports,2024,Sep,Am J Case Rep. 2024 Sep 16;25:e944286. doi: 10.12659/AJCR.944286.,United States,423,11416134
40292193,Protease activity-based nanobiosensors for early detection of pancreatic cancer.,"Five-year survival rate for pancreatic cancer patients has increased to 12.8% afterthe initial diagnosis, still making it one of the deadliest cancertypes. This disease is known as the ""silent killer"" because early detection is challenging due to the location of the pancreas in the body and the nonspecific clinical symptoms. The Bossmann group has developed ultrasensitive nanobiosensors for protease/arginase detection comprised of Fe/Fe(3)O(4) nanoparticles, cyanine 5.5, and designer peptide sequences linked to TCPP. Initial data obtained from both gene expression analysis and protease/arginase activity detection in serum indicated the feasibility of early pancreatic cancer detection. Several matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs, -1, -3, and -9), cathepsins (CTS) B and E, neutrophil elastase, and urokinase plaminogen activator (uPA) have been identified as candidates for proximal biomarkers. In this study, we have confirmed our initial results from 2018 performing serum sample analysis assays using a larger group sample size (n = 159), which included localized (n=33) and metastatic pancreatic cancer (n=50), pancreatitis (n=26), and an age-matched healthy control group (n=50). The data obtained from the eight nanobiosensors capable of ultrasensitive protease and arginase activity measurements were analyzed by means of an optimized information fusion-based hierarchical decision structure. This permits the modeling of early-stage detection of pancreatic cancer as a multi-class classification problem. The most striking result is that this methodology permits the detection of localized pancreatic cancers from serum analyses with around 96% accuracy.",,Covarrubias-Zambrano O; Agarwal D; Kalubowilage M; Ehsan S; Yapa AS; Covarrubias J; Kasi A; Natarajan B; Bossmann SH,Medical research archives,2024,Jul,Med Res Arch. 2024 Jul;12(7):5632. doi: 10.18103/mra.v12i7.5632.,United States,433,12031639
32638367,Phase I/II study of adding intraperitoneal paclitaxel in patients with pancreatic cancer and peritoneal metastasis.,"BACKGROUND: Intraperitoneal chemotherapy using paclitaxel is considered an experimental approach for treating peritoneal carcinomatosis. This study aimed to determine the recommended dose, and to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety, of the combination of intravenous gemcitabine, intravenous nab-paclitaxel and intraperitoneal paclitaxel in patients with pancreatic cancer and peritoneal metastasis. METHODS: The frequencies of dose-limiting toxicities were evaluated, and the recommended dose was determined in phase I. The primary endpoint of the phase II analysis was overall survival rate at 1 year. Secondary endpoints were antitumour effects, symptom-relieving effects, safety and overall survival. RESULTS: The recommended doses of intravenous gemcitabine, intravenous nab-paclitaxel and intraperitoneal paclitaxel were 800, 75 and 20 mg/m(2) respectively. Among 46 patients enrolled in phase II, the median time to treatment failure was 6.0 (range 0-22.6) months. The response and disease control rates were 21 of 43 and 41 of 43 respectively. Ascites disappeared in 12 of 30 patients, and cytology became negative in 18 of 46. The median survival time was 14.5 months, and the 1-year overall survival rate was 61 per cent. Conversion surgery was performed in eight of 46 patients, and those who underwent resection survived significantly longer than those who were not treated surgically (median survival not reached versus 12.4 months). Grade 3-4 haematological toxicities developed in 35 of 46 patients, whereas non-haematological adverse events occurred in seven patients.

37573294,Treatment with anticancer drugs for advanced pancreatic cancer: a systematic review.,"BACKGROUND: Patients with advanced pancreatic cancer have a poor prognosis and high burden of cancer-related symptoms. It is necessary to assess the trade-off of clinical benefits and possible harms of treatments with anticancer drugs (TAD). This systematic review aims to compare the effectiveness of TAD versus supportive care or no treatment, considering all patient-important outcomes. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Epistemonikos. Two reviewers performed selection, data extraction and risk of bias assessment. We assessed certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. RESULTS: We included 14 randomised controlled trials. Chemotherapy may result in a slight increase in overall survival (MD: 2.97 months (95%CI 1.23, 4.70)) and fewer hospital days (MD: -6.7 (-8.3, -5.1)), however, the evidence is very uncertain about its effect on symptoms, quality of life, functional status, and adverse events. Targeted/biological therapy may result in little to no difference in overall survival and a slight increment in progression-free survival (HR: 0.83 (95%CI 0.63, 1.10)), but probably results in more adverse events (RR: 5.54 (95%CI 1.24, 23.97)). The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of immunotherapy in overall survival and functional status. CONCLUSIONS: The evidence is very uncertain about whether the benefits of using treatment with anticancer drugs outweigh their risks for patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. This uncertainty is further highlighted when considering immunotherapy or a second line of chemotherapy and thus, best supportive care would be an appropriate alternative.

36476236,Landmarks in pancreatic cancer studies.,"Pancreatic cancer is a rare but fatal disease. Patients present advanced disease due to the lack of or typical symptoms when the tumor is still localized. A high-quality image processing system has been in practice to detect the pancreatic tumor and determine the possibility of surgery, and preoperative methods, such as ERCP are increasingly used to complement the staging modality. Pancreaticoduodenectomy is one of the complicated surgeries with potential morbidity. The minimally invasive pancreatic resections, both robot-assisted and laparoscopic, have become a part of standard surgical practice worldwide over the last decade. Moreover, advancements in adjuvant chemotherapy have improved the long-term outcomes in current clinical practice. The systemic conservative treatment, including targeted agents, remains the mainstay of treatment for patients with advanced disease. An increasing number of studies are focused on modulating the pancreatic tumor microenvironment to improve the efficacy of the immunotherapeutic strategies. Herein, the role of preoperative therapy, the novel surgical strategy, and individualized systemic treatment in pancreatic cancer is investigated. Also, the randomized controlled studies that have defined the neoadjuvant and surgical management of pancreatic cancer have been summarized.",,Xu F; Huang M; Bai Y; Yin X; Yan J; Liu F; Chen J; Weng X,Cancer cell international,2022,Dec,Cancer Cell Int. 2022 Dec 7;22(1):383. doi: 10.1186/s12935-022-02803-8.,England,391,9730569
39077277,Investigation of Pulmonary Saddle Embolism Caused by Metastasis-Induced Hypercoagulability Originating From Pancreatic Cancer.,"An adult male cadaver, approximately 60 years of age, was dissected as part of an eight-week didactic course. It was found that the subject had evidence of pancreatic cancer with signs of metastasis as well as significant bilateral pulmonary artery clotting. In particular, a saddle embolism was observed, and the cause of death was listed as sudden pulmonary failure. Malignant tumors are often accompanied by hypercoagulable states and increased risk of thromboembolism. Because the clots showed lines of Zahn on histology, we can infer that this hypercoagulable state preceded death and may have been related to the presence of pancreatic carcinoma. There are few recorded cases of pulmonary saddle embolism being the fatal event in cases of underlying pancreatic cancer. The extensive clotting observed in the inferior vena cava and pulmonary arteries demonstrates to clinicians that patients, especially those with pancreatic cancer, are at higher risk for thromboembolic events. This case report also serves as a reminder that instances of pulmonary failure or sudden death because of pulmonary saddle embolism may be caused by underlying visceral neoplasms, such as pancreatic cancer.",,Park E; Petrovic MT; Pearce AN; Phillips MA; Ramos J,Cureus,2024,Jun,Cureus. 2024 Jun 29;16(6):e63477. doi: 10.7759/cureus.63477. eCollection 2024 Jun.,United States,316,11286297
40046529,Palliative management for malignant biliary obstruction and gastric outlet obstruction from pancreatic cancer.,"Pancreatic cancer is among the leading causes of gastrointestinal cancer-related death, with a dismal prognosis. Over 80% of pancreatic cancer patients present with advanced disease, making curative resection unfeasible. These patients are often presented with malignant biliary obstruction (MBO) and gastric outlet obstruction (GOO). In these cases, palliative management is aimed to alleviate symptoms, enhance quality of life, and facilitate subsequent chemotherapy. Currently, neoadjuvant chemotherapy is frequently used in both borderline resectable and resectable pancreatic cancer, necessitating effective biliary and gastrointestinal drainage in a growing number of patients. Traditionally, surgical bypass was the gold standard, performed via either a minimally invasive or open approach. However, notable progress has emerged in developing endoscopic techniques, such as endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) stenting for MBO and endoscopic enteral stenting for GOO. While these procedures provide rapid symptom relief, they are associated with higher stent dysfunction rates and more frequent re-intervention needs. When ERCP fails, percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage is a widely accepted alternative for MBO. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided techniques, including EUS-guided biliary drainage and EUS-guided gastroenterostomy, have recently gained prominence. Emerging clinical data suggest that these methods may be superior, potentially becoming the preferred first-line palliative treatment for unresectable pancreatic cancer. This review will summarize the current evidence on managing MBO and GOO in patients with pancreatic cancer.",,Wu P; Chen K; He J,Annals of gastroenterological surgery,2025,Mar,Ann Gastroenterol Surg. 2024 Dec 26;9(2):218-225. doi: 10.1002/ags3.12902. eCollection 2025 Mar.,Japan,528,11877337
39129682,Predictors of Psychiatric Complications in Patients with Pancreatic Cancer: A Retrospective Cohort Study.,"BACKGROUND: The relevant survey has shown a high incidence of psychiatric complications in patients with pancreatic cancer. While some studies have explored the factors influencing psychological complications in pancreatic cancer patients, some factors validated in other populations have not been confirmed in the pancreatic cancer population. This study aims to explore the predictors of psychiatric complications in patients with pancreatic cancer. METHODS: Patients with pancreatic cancer admitted to Yueqing People's Hospital Affiliated to Wenzhou Medical University, from January 2021 to January 2022 were retrospectively analyzed. The structured clinical interview (SCID-I) based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) was used by nurses to assess the incidence of psychiatric complications during hospitalization (baseline) and 3 months after the start of treatment. Binary logistic regression was used to identify predictors of psychiatric complications. RESULTS: 80 patients were enrolled in this study and 8 patients were diagnosed with psychiatric complications at base line. Among the rest 72 patients, 8 patients (11.11%) had new-onset psychiatric complications at 3-month follow-up. Gender (Odds Ratio (OR) = 1.674, p = 0.019), monthly income (OR = 1.735, p = 0.023) and sadness (M.D. Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI)) (OR = 1.804, p = 0.001) were all predictors for psychiatric complications in patients with pancreatic cancer.

30561407,Epidemiology and risk factors of pancreatic cancer.,"The most frequent pancreatic cancer is pancreatic adenocarcinoma. It has high and early locally and distant invasiveness; this is the reason why it often shows little sign or symptoms in early stage and poor prognosis after the diagnosis, frequently in advanced stage. Although it is possible to detect this tumor in early stage because of its neoplastic precursor (PanINs). Epidemiological data shows that pancreatic cancer is not very common but obvious it is one of the most neoplastic death-cause in the world. The trend of incidence is quite increasing through years, proportionally to the increase of risk factors. About risk factors, it is not easy to detect in all the cases but it is known the role of some of that: there are hereditary risk factors, such as genetic pattern like HBOC, HNPCC, FAP, PJS, FAMMM, HP and CF and environmental ones (modifiable) such as smoke, alcohol consumption, chronic pancreatitis, obesity and diabetes mellitus. This narrative review aims to analyze the epidemiological data of pancreatic cancer and associated risk factors.","Adenocarcinoma/*epidemiology; Adult; Aged; Alcohol Drinking/epidemiology; Cocarcinogenesis; Diabetes Mellitus/epidemiology; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplastic Syndromes, Hereditary/epidemiology; Obesity/epidemiology; Pancreatic Neoplasms/*epidemiology; Pancreatitis, Chronic/epidemiology; Risk Factors; Smoking/epidemiology",Capasso M; Franceschi M; Rodriguez-Castro KI; Crafa P; Cambie G; Miraglia C; Barchi A; Nouvenne A; Leandro G; Meschi T; De' Angelis GL; Di Mario F,Acta bio-medica : Atenei Parmensis,2018,Dec,Acta Biomed. 2018 Dec 17;89(9-S):141-146. doi: 10.23750/abm.v89i9-S.7923.,Italy,243,6502190
36984494,A Retrospective Study of the Efficacy and Safety of Naldemedine for Treatment of Opioid-Induced Constipation in Patients with Hepatobiliary Pancreatic Cancer.,"Background and Objectives: Opioid analgesics, which are used for cancer-related pain management, cause opioid-induced constipation (OIC). Naldemedine, a peripheral opioid receptor antagonist, is an OIC-modifying agent, but no focused efficacy and safety analysis has been conducted for its use in hepatobiliary pancreatic cancers. We performed a multi-institutional study on the efficacy and safety of naldemedine in patients with hepatobiliary pancreatic cancer using opioids in clinical practice. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively evaluated patients with hepatobiliary pancreatic cancer (including liver, biliary tract, and pancreatic cancers) treated with opioids and naldemedine during hospitalization at ten institutions in Japan from June 2017 to August 2019. We assessed the frequency of bowel movements before and after the initiation of naldemedine therapy. Responders were defined as patients who defecated >/=3 times/week, with an increase from a baseline of >/=1 defecations/week over seven days after the initiation of naldemedine administration. Results: Thirty-four patients were observed for one week before and one week after starting naldemedine. The frequency of bowel movements increased by one over the baseline frequency or to at least thrice per week in 21 patients. The response rate was 61.7% (95% confidence interval: 45.4-78.0%). The median number of weekly bowel movements before and after naldemedine treatment was 2 (range: 0-9) and 6 (range: 1-17), respectively, in the overall population (n = 34); the increase in the number of bowel movements following naldemedine administration was statistically significant (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, p < 0.0001). Diarrhea was the predominant gastrointestinal symptom, and 10 (29.4%) patients experienced grade 1, grade 2, or grade 3 adverse events. The only other adverse event included fatigue in one patient; grade 2-4 adverse events were absent. Conclusions: Naldemedine is effective, and its use may be safe in clinical practice for patients with hepatobiliary pancreatic cancer receiving opioid analgesics.","Humans; Analgesics, Opioid/adverse effects; *Narcotic Antagonists/therapeutic use; *Opioid-Induced Constipation/drug therapy; *Pancreatic Neoplasms/complications/drug therapy; Retrospective Studies; Naltrexone/analogs & derivatives",Kamiya T; Imai H; Fujita Y; Hiruta E; Masuno T; Yamazaki S; Tanaka H; Sandoh M; Takei S; Arai K; Nishiba H; Mogi J; Koizuka S; Saito T; Obayashi K; Kaira K; Minato K,"Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)",2023,Mar,Medicina (Kaunas). 2023 Mar 2;59(3):492. doi: 10.3390/medicina59030492.,Switzerland,344,10051263
36980796,Treatment Costs and Social Burden of Pancreatic Cancer.,"(1) Background: Pancreatic cancer is the cancer with the third-highest mortality rate, and forecasts indicate its growing share in morbidity. The basis of treatment is inpatient chemotherapy and there is a strong focus on palliative care. (2) Methods: A literature review was conducted based on the rapid review methodology in PubMed and Cochrane databases. The search was supplemented with publications from the snowball search. Qualitative assessment of included publications was performed using AMSTAR2 modified scheme. (3) Results: The review included 17 publications, of which majority concerned direct costs related to the adopted treatment regimen. Most of the publications focused on comparing the cost-effectiveness of drug therapies and the costs of palliative treatment. Other publications concerned indirect costs generated by pancreatic cancer. They particularly focused on the economic burden of lost productivity due to sickness absence. (4) Conclusion: The increase in the incidence of pancreatic cancer translates into an increase in the costs of the health care system and indirect costs. Due to the significant share of hospitalization in the health care structure, direct costs are increasing. The inpatient treatment regimen and side effects translate into a loss of productivity for patients with pancreatic cancer. Among gastrointestinal cancers, pancreatic cancer generates the second largest indirect costs, although it has a much lower incidence rate than the dominant colorectal cancer. This indicates a significant problem of the economic burden of this cancer.",,Cipora E; Partyka O; Pajewska M; Czerw A; Sygit K; Sygit M; Kaczmarski M; Mekal D; Krzych-Falta E; Jurczak A; Karakiewicz-Krawczyk K; Wieder-Huszla S; Banas T; Bandurska E; Ciecko W; Deptala A,Cancers,2023,Mar,Cancers (Basel). 2023 Mar 22;15(6):1911. doi: 10.3390/cancers15061911.,Switzerland,571,10047484
36554049,Association between Survival Duration of Older Patients with Advanced Unresectable Pancreatic Cancer and Appetite Loss: A Retrospective Cohort Study.,"This retrospective cohort study clarified associations between trajectories in palliative care and appetite loss among older patients with advanced unresectable pancreatic cancer and reviewed pancreatic cancer diagnosis among these populations in rural community hospitals. Patients aged >65 years and with pancreatic cancer in a rural community hospital were enrolled. The primary outcome was survival duration from the time of pancreatic cancer diagnosis. Participants were divided into those with and without appetite loss. Cumulative event-free survival rates were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method, analyzed using the log-rank test, and stratified by factors with statistically significant between-group differences (serum albumin). The mean participant age was 84.14 (SD, 8.34) years; 31.4% were men. Significant between-group differences were noted in albumin concentration and survival duration. Kaplan-Meier curves showed a significant between-group difference in survival probability (p < 0.001). Survival duration significantly differed after stratification by albumin level (p < 0.001). Appetite loss may be a useful symptom for predicting mortality among older patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer, and hypoalbuminemia may accelerate deterioration in their conditions. Accordingly, subjective appetite loss observed by patients and families should be assessed to predict mortality, and it is advisable for physicians to promptly discuss relevant and advanced directives at appropriate timings.",,Ohta R; Moriwaki Y; Sano C,"Healthcare (Basel, Switzerland)",2022,Dec,Healthcare (Basel). 2022 Dec 14;10(12):2525. doi: 10.3390/healthcare10122525.,Switzerland,279,9778676
37554534,Retrospective study of testosterone deficiency and symptom burden in patients with pancreatic cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Pancreatic cancer patients have poor quality of life. Testosterone deficiency is associated with constitutional symptoms and sexual dysfunction which may contribute to poor quality of life. We investigated the prevalence of screening for and presence of testosterone deficiency in male pancreatic cancer patients. METHODS: To determine the frequency of screening for testosterone deficiency in pancreatic cancer patients, our institution's electronic medical record system was queried for male patients diagnosed with a pancreatic mass between 2006 and 2020 and an available testosterone level. In a separate analysis, total testosterone was measured in serum samples from a cohort of 89 male pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients. Low serum testosterone was defined as <300 ng/dL. RESULTS: One thousand five hundred and sixty-six male patients were identified with a pancreatic mass, and 35 (2.2%) also had a testosterone level. In our analysis cohort, 44 of 89 patients (49.4%) were found to have low serum testosterone. Symptoms consistent with testosterone deficiency were documented for 70% of these patients, with fatigue being the most common. Testosterone level had no significant association with progression-free survival (PFS) (P=0.66) or overall survival (OS) (P=0.95). CONCLUSIONS: Testosterone deficiency is common but rarely assessed in male patients with pancreatic cancer. Further studies are warranted to explore the possibility of testosterone supplementation to improve quality of life in this patient population.",,Kazarian AG; Conger HK; Mott SL; Loeffler BT; Dempewolf SM; Coleman KL; Pearlman AM; Chan CHF; Talbert EE,Translational andrology and urology,2023,Jul,Transl Androl Urol. 2023 Jul 31;12(7):1079-1089. doi: 10.21037/tau-22-684.

38020651,Early versus delayed computed tomography-guided celiac plexus neurolysis for palliative pain management in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer: a retrospective cohort study.,"INTRODUCTION: Abdominal and back pain is the most frequent symptom in patients with pancreatic cancer, with pain management being extremely challenging. This study aimed to evaluate pain control, opioid consumption, pain-interfered quality of life, and survival after early and delayed computed tomography (CT)-guided celiac plexus neurolysis (CPN). METHODS: A retrospective analysis of pancreatic cancer patients receiving CPN for pain (n = 56) between June 2018 and June 2021 was done. The patients were grouped as early group (n = 22) and delayed group (n = 34) on the basis of the presence of persistent refractory pain according to expert consensus on refractory cancer pain. RESULTS: Both groups were comparable in demographic characteristics and baseline pain conditions measured using the numeric rating scale (5.77 +/- 1.23 vs. 6.27 +/- 1.21; p = 0.141). The pain scores were significantly reduced in both groups; early CPN resulted in significantly lower scores from 3 to 5 months. The opioid consumption gradually decreased to a minimum at 2 weeks but increased at 1 month (35.56 +/- 30.14 mg and 50.48 +/- 47.90 mg, respectively); significantly larger consumption from 2 to 4 months was seen in the delayed group. The total pain interference was lower than baseline in all patients, with significant improvement after early CPN in sleep, appetite, enjoyment of life, and mood. The average survival time of the two groups was comparable. CONCLUSION: Early application of CT-guided CPN for patients with advanced pancreatic cancer may help reduce pain exacerbation and opioids consumption, without influencing the survival.",,Lu F; Wang X; Tian J; Li X,Frontiers in neurology,2023,,Front Neurol. 2023 Nov 7;14:1292758. doi: 10.3389/fneur.2023.1292758. eCollection 2023.,Switzerland,326,10661893
27114434,Systemic Chemotherapy in Advanced Pancreatic Cancer.,"Pancreatic cancer remains one of the most lethal cancers. These patients often have multiple symptoms, and integrated supportive care is critical in helping them remain well for as long as possible. Fluorouracil-based chemotherapy is known to improve overall survival (OS) by approximately 3 months, compared to the best supportive care alone. A 1997 study comparing gemcitabine and fluorouracil treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer patients showed an improvement in OS of 1 month in patients receiving gemcitabine. Over the next 10 years, multiple randomized studies compared singleagent gemcitabine with combination chemotherapy and showed no effective survival improvement. However, the addition of erlotinib, an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor, was associated with a significant improvement in OS of approximately 2 weeks. However, adoption of this regimen has not been widespread because of its limited effect and added toxicity. Two clinical trials have recently prolonged OS in advanced pancreatic cancer patients by almost 1 year. The first compared FOLFIRINOX with gemcitabine alone, and was associated with a significant improvement in median survival. The second compared gemcitabine and nabpaclitaxel with gemcitabine alone, and was associated with improvements in OS. At present, these regimens are considered standard treatment for patients with good performance statuses.",Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use; Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use; Deoxycytidine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives; Female; Fluorouracil/administration & dosage; Humans; Immunotherapy/methods; Male; Molecular Targeted Therapy/methods; Pancreatic Neoplasms/*drug therapy; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Treatment Outcome; Gemcitabine,Lee HS; Park SW,Gut and liver,2016,May,Gut Liver. 2016 May 23;10(3):340-7. doi: 10.5009/gnl15465.,Korea (South),332,4849685
32423157,Genetic Alterations Featuring Biological Models to Tailor Clinical Management of Pancreatic Cancer Patients.,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. This high mortality rate is due to the disease's lack of symptoms, resulting in a late diagnosis. Biomarkers and treatment options for pancreatic cancer are also limited. In order to overcome this, new research models and novel approaches to discovering PDAC biomarkers are required. In this review, we outline the hereditary and somatic causes of PDAC and provide an overview of the recent genome wide association studies (GWAS) and pathway analysis studies. We also provide a summary of some of the systems used to study PDAC, including established and primary cell lines, patient-derived xenografts (PDX), and newer models such as organoids and organ-on-chip.

40093983,The dual role of gut microbiota in pancreatic cancer: new insights into onset and treatment.,"Pancreatic cancer ranks among the most lethal digestive malignancies, exhibiting a steadily increasing incidence and mortality worldwide. Despite significant advances in cancer research, the 5-year survival rate remains below 10%, predominantly due to delayed diagnosis and limited therapeutic options. Concurrently, the gut microbiota-an integral component of host physiology-has emerged as a crucial player in the pathogenesis of pancreatic cancer. Mounting evidence indicates that alterations in gut microbial composition and function may influence tumor initiation, progression, and response to therapy. This review provides an in-depth examination of the intricate interplay between the gut microbiome and pancreatic cancer, highlighting potential diagnostic biomarkers and exploring microbiome-targeted therapeutic strategies to improve patient outcomes.",,Cheng H; Guo H; Wen C; Sun G; Tang F; Li Y,Therapeutic advances in medical oncology,2025,,Ther Adv Med Oncol. 2025 Mar 15;17:17588359251324882. doi: 10.1177/17588359251324882. eCollection 2025.,England,355,11909682
40392528,Anatomically resectable versus biologically borderline resectable pancreatic cancer definition: refining the border beyond anatomical criteria and biological aggressiveness.,"BACKGROUND: The anatomically resectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma treatment sequence is still debated. Heterogeneity in patient characteristics within this group may explain literature discrepancies. To overcome these limits, a biologically borderline resectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma category has been analysed according to institutional criteria. The aim of this study was to examine the characteristics and outcomes of patients with biologically borderline resectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and determine whether they represent a distinct clinical and prognostic subgroup. METHODS: Data from all consecutive patients who underwent surgical resection for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma between 2015 and 2022 were retrospectively analysed. Biologically borderline resectable disease was classified by the presence of one or more of the following: carbohydrate antigen 19-9 >/=200 U/ml, cancer-related symptoms lasting >40 days, and radiological suspicion of regional lymph node metastases at diagnosis. RESULTS: In total, 886 patients were included in the study and divided into anatomically borderline resectable (266 patients (30%)) and anatomically resectable (620 patients (70%)), which was further divided into resectable (R; 397 patients (64%)) and biologically borderline resectable (223 patients (36%)). Neoadjuvant treatment was administered in 245 patients (92.1%) in the anatomically borderline resectable group, 82 patients (20.7%) in the R group, and 135 patients (60.5%) in the biologically borderline resectable group. After a median follow-up of 45 (95% c.i. 42 to 48) months, the median disease-specific survival in the biologically borderline resectable group was 40 months compared with 59 months in the R group (P < 0.001) and 40 months in the anatomically borderline resectable group (P = 0.570). In the upfront surgery cohort, the median disease-specific survival was worse for biologically borderline resectable patients compared with R patients (27 versus 54 months respectively, P < 0.001). Biologically borderline resectable was also independently associated with worse disease-specific survival, together with age, tumour size at diagnosis, and anatomically borderline resectable. The same, except for age, were also predictors of worse event-free survival. CONCLUSION: Despite their identical anatomical appearance, resectable and biologically borderline resectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma represent two distinct prognostic entities, warranting separate evaluation and, potentially, different treatment approaches.","Humans; *Pancreatic Neoplasms/pathology/surgery/mortality; Male; Female; Aged; Retrospective Studies; *Carcinoma, Pancreatic Ductal/surgery/pathology/mortality; Middle Aged; *Pancreatectomy/methods; Neoadjuvant Therapy; Prognosis; CA-19-9 Antigen/blood; Lymphatic Metastasis; Aged, 80 and over; Adult; Neoplasm Staging",Belfiori G; De Stefano F; Tamburrino D; Gasparini G; Aleotti F; Camisa PR; Arcangeli C; Schiavo Lena M; Pecorelli N; Palumbo D; Partelli S; De Cobelli F; Reni M; Crippa S; Falconi M,BJS open,2025,May,BJS Open. 2025 May 7;9(3):zraf033. doi: 10.1093/bjsopen/zraf033.,England,395,12090895
29644986,Evaluation of fatigue in patients with pancreatic cancer receiving chemotherapy treatment: a cross-sectional observational study.,"BACKGROUND AND AIM OF THE WORK: Cancer-related fatigue (CRF) is one of the most common symptoms experienced by cancer patients (CPs) and negatively affects quality of life. Although CRF is frequently experienced, it is often underreported, underdiagnosed and undertreated. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the level of fatigue in patients with pancreatic cancer undergoing chemotherapy and to analyse its correlation with patients' demographic and clinical variables. METHODS: A cross-sectional observational study was implemented in the Oncology Day Hospital of a Northern Italian hospital. A sample of 48 patients receiving chemotherapy were evaluated through the Brief Fatigue Inventory Italian version (BFI-I) between 1 May and 12 October 2016. Data were statistically analysed. RESULTS: Most of our patients (94%) experienced fatigue. Women as well as patients with an age >/=65 years reported more fatigue. Anemia, pain and a weight loss of over 16 kg in the last 6 months were significantly related to the perception of fatigue. Regarding life habits, smoking was related to high global score of BFI-I. CONCLUSIONS: In accordance with literature, our study suggests that fatigue is a frequent symptom influenced by many constitutional, clinical and environmental factors. Our results highlight the need for an early and regular evaluation of fatigue among cancer patients, in order to implement all those pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions with proven efficacy in attenuating this symptom.",Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Anemia/etiology; Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use; Cross-Sectional Studies; Fatigue/chemically induced/*etiology; Female; Habits; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pancreatic Neoplasms/complications/*drug therapy; Quality of Life; Severity of Illness Index; Smoking/epidemiology; Surveys and Questionnaires,Di Marco M; Rubbi I; Baldi A; Di Lorenzo R; Magnani D; Cremonini V; Sarli L; Artioli G; Ferri P,Acta bio-medica : Atenei Parmensis,2018,Feb,Acta Biomed. 2018 Feb 27;89(4-S):18-27. doi: 10.23750/abm.v89i4-S.7063.,Italy,520,6357627
38517148,Unmet Needs in the Process of Chemotherapy Provision in Pancreatic Cancer Patients from the Healthcare Provider Perspective: A Phenomenological Study in Greece.,"INTRODUCTION: Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer death overall, with 1.5 years life expectancy and minimal therapeutic progress in the last decades. Despite the burden it causes, there is little research on the needs of this specific population. This study aimed to explore healthcare professionals' views on providing care and patients' unsatisfied needs. METHODS: This qualitative descriptive study was carried out at a cancer hospital in Northern Greece. A total of 12 participants (6 physicians and 6 nurses), treating patients with pancreatic cancer undergoing chemotherapy, were recruited through purposive sampling and underwent face-to-face semi-structured interviews. Data were analyzed through the thematic analysis method in NVivo12 software. RESULTS: The analysis highlighted two themes: ""needs of patients with pancreatic cancer"" consisted of 6 subthemes (""daily activities"", ""symptoms management"", ""psychological support"", ""information needs"", ""multidisciplinary care"" and ""end-of-life care"") and ""needs of healthcare professionals"" had 3 subthemes (""psychological support"", ""education"" and ""organizational support""). Several symptoms are identified and affect the daily activities of these patients, and psychological support is important for the majority of them, even at the time of diagnosis. The participants express dissatisfaction with the absence of palliative care structures and services and stated that an interdisciplinary approach would improve the quality of care.

34885188,On the Evaluation of a Novel Hypoxic 3D Pancreatic Cancer Model as a Tool for Radiotherapy Treatment Screening.,"Tissue engineering is evolving to mimic intricate ecosystems of tumour microenvironments (TME) to more readily map realistic in vivo niches of cancerous tissues. Such advanced cancer tissue models enable more accurate preclinical assessment of treatment strategies. Pancreatic cancer is a dangerous disease with high treatment resistance that is directly associated with a highly complex TME. More specifically, the pancreatic cancer TME includes (i) complex structure and complex extracellular matrix (ECM) protein composition; (ii) diverse cell populations (e.g., stellate cells), cancer associated fibroblasts, endothelial cells, which interact with the cancer cells and promote resistance to treatment and metastasis; (iii) accumulation of high amounts of (ECM), which leads to the creation of a fibrotic/desmoplastic reaction around the tumour; and (iv) heterogeneous environmental gradients such as hypoxia, which result from vessel collapse and stiffness increase in the fibrotic/desmoplastic area of the TME. These unique hallmarks are not effectively recapitulated in traditional preclinical research despite radiotherapeutic resistance being largely connected to them. Herein, we investigate, for the first time, the impact of in vitro hypoxia (5% O(2)) on the radiotherapy treatment response of pancreatic cancer cells (PANC-1) in a novel polymer (polyurethane) based highly macroporous scaffold that was surface modified with proteins (fibronectin) for ECM mimicry. More specifically, PANC-1 cells were seeded in fibronectin coated macroporous scaffolds and were cultured for four weeks in in vitro normoxia (21% O(2)), followed by a two day exposure to either in vitro hypoxia (5% O(2)) or maintenance in in vitro normoxia. Thereafter, in situ post-radiation monitoring (one day, three days, seven days post-irradiation) of the 3D cell cultures took place via quantification of (i) live/dead and apoptotic profiles and (ii) ECM (collagen-I) and HIF-1a secretion by the cancer cells. Our results showed increased post-radiation viability, reduced apoptosis, and increased collagen-I and HIF-1a secretion in in vitro hypoxia compared to normoxic cultures, revealing hypoxia-induced radioprotection. Overall, this study employed a low cost, animal free model enabling (i) the possibility of long-term in vitro hypoxic 3D cell culture for pancreatic cancer, and (ii) in vitro hypoxia associated PDAC radio-protection development. Our novel platform for radiation treatment screening can be used for long-term in vitro post-treatment observations as well as for fractionated radiotherapy treatment.",,Wishart G; Gupta P; Nisbet A; Schettino G; Velliou E,Cancers,2021,Dec,Cancers (Basel). 2021 Dec 2;13(23):6080. doi: 10.3390/cancers13236080.,Switzerland,773,8657010
36582884,"Screening of pancreatic cancer: Target population, optimal timing and how?","Pancreatic cancer patients usually present at a late stage due to subtle clinical manifestations. One of the most predictive prognostic factors in pancreatic cancer is the pancreatic cancer stage at diagnosis; therefore, early diagnosis is essential. Until now, pancreatic cancer screening has not become a standard practice for the general population due to the low incidence. In current circumstances, targeting individuals with a high risk of pancreatic cancer may be more rational. Several screening modalities for pancreatic cancer have also become debatable topics. Therefore, this article will review current evidence and recommendations regarding pancreatic screening cancer protocol in general and in high-risk populations.",,Waleleng BJ; Adiwinata R; Wenas NT; Haroen H; Rotty L; Gosal F; Rotty L; Winarta J; Waleleng A; Simadibrata M,Annals of medicine and surgery (2012),2022,Dec,Ann Med Surg (Lond). 2022 Nov 5;84:104814. doi: 10.1016/j.amsu.2022.104814. eCollection 2022 Dec.,England,250,9793126
32884283,A New Fusion Peptide Targeting Pancreatic Cancer and Inhibiting Tumor Growth.,"BACKGROUND: Pancreatic cancer is a highly malignant tumor of the digestive system. Early pancreatic cancer is often difficult to diagnosis due to its atypical clinical symptoms. Patients with pancreatic cancer have a very poor prognosis because they have lost the opportunity for radical surgical tumor resection and they are less sensitive to the clinically used radiotherapy and chemotherapy. METHODS: In this study, a peptide targeting pancreatic cancer cells was screened by phage display technology, and its targeting property was evaluated in vitro using PANC1 cells by fluorescence imaging and flow cytometry. Furthermore, the targeting peptide was conjugated to the pro-apoptotic KLAKLAKKLAKLAK (KLA), the fusion peptide and its targeting ability that allowing KLA to specifically enter pancreatic tumor cells in vitro and in vivo was confirmed by fluorescence imaging and in vivo imaging system (IVIS). Its mechanism was determined using flow cytometry, mitochondrial membrane potential evaluation and Western blot. The inhibitory effect on pancreatic tumor growth and toxic effects were evaluated by animal experiment. RESULTS: Due to the internalization facilitated by the targeting mechanism of the targeting peptide, KLA specifically entered pancreatic cancer cells, destroyed mitochondria and induced apoptosis. The fusion peptide and its targeting ability that allowing KLA to specifically enter pancreatic tumor cells and exert a significant inhibitory effect on pancreatic tumor growth with reduced toxic effects.

31238554,Alteration of Epigenetic Modifiers in Pancreatic Cancer and Its Clinical Implication.,"The incidence of pancreatic cancer has considerably increased in the past decade. Pancreatic cancer has the worst prognosis among the cancers of the digestive tract because the pancreas is located in the posterior abdominal cavity, and most patients do not show clinical symptoms for early detection. Approximately 55% of all patients are diagnosed with pancreatic cancer only after the tumors metastasize. Therefore, identifying useful biomarkers for early diagnosis and screening high-risk groups are important to improve pancreatic cancer therapy. Recent emerging evidence has suggested that genetic and epigenetic alterations play a crucial role in the molecular aspects of pancreatic tumorigenesis. Here, we summarize recent progress in our understanding of the epigenetic alterations in pancreatic cancer and propose potential synthetic lethal strategies to target these genetic defects to treat this deadly disease.",,Hung YH; Hsu MC; Chen LT; Hung WC; Pan MR,Journal of clinical medicine,2019,Jun,J Clin Med. 2019 Jun 24;8(6):903. doi: 10.3390/jcm8060903.,Switzerland,245,6617267
36412114,Liposomal irinotecan with fluorouracil and leucovorin after gemcitabine-based therapy in Japanese patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer: additional safety analysis of a randomized phase 2 trial.,"BACKGROUND: Nanoliposomal irinotecan (nal-IRI) was recently authorized in Japan for unresectable pancreatic cancer after disease progression following chemotherapy. Physicians now consider certain aspects of nal-IRI safety profile as slightly different from conventional irinotecan. This report aims to explore additional aspects of the nal-IRI safety in Japanese phase 2 study. METHODS: We analyzed the incidence, time to first onset, and time to resolution for adverse events that require special attention and other selected toxicities in the nal-IRI combination group (n = 46). RESULTS: Leukopenia/neutropenia (76.1%/71.7%), diarrhea (58.7%) and hepatic dysfunction (41.3%) were the most commonly reported treatment-emergent adverse events, with a median time to onset of 21.0 days (range: 8, 97), 9.0 days (1, 61) and 22.0 days (2, 325), respectively, and a median time to resolution of 8.0 days (95% confidence intervals: 8, 9), 4.0 days (4, 8) and 40.0 days (9, -), respectively. Eight patients experienced Grade >/= 3 diarrhea and their symptoms were well controlled by dose modification except one patient who had drug withdrawal. The median time to resolution for Grade >/= 3 and Grade </= 2 diarrhea was 17.5 days (95% confidence intervals: 1, 31) and 4 days (3, 7), respectively. Anorexia occurred in 28/46 patients (60.9%) with a median time to onset of 4.0 days (range: 2, 132) and a median time to resolution of 12.0 days (95% confidence intervals: 6, 26). CONCLUSIONS: We explored safety profile of nal-IRI combination regimen recognized as effective and tolerable treatment for Japanese unresectable pancreatic cancer patients.

33584541,A Diabetic Patient Complicated With Pancreatic Cancer After Using Liraglutide: A Case Report.,"BACKGROUND: Diabetes and cancer are both multifactorial diseases, and epidemiologic evidence indicates that diabetes may be associated with the incidence of certain types of cancer. In diabetes the risk of pancreatic cancer is increased significantly. However, whether certain diabetes treatment being related with the risk of pancreatic cancer remains unclear. In this report, we presented a case of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma in a diabetic patient in China after being treated with liraglutide, a novel glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analog. CASE REPORT: A 71-year-old Han Chinese man who had had a type 2 diabetes for 25 years presented at the endocrinology department with discomfort in the left upper quadrant of abdomen for 10 days. The patient's vital signs and laboratory findings were unremarkable except for the elevated level of carbohydrate antigen (CA19-9). The upper abdomen routine enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan showed low density of the pancreatic body and tail, and the histopathological result of the pancreatic biopsy samples was pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma with regional lymph node metastasis. We reviewed his former medical records and found that liraglutide was added to his hypoglycemic treatment regimen 20 months ago. At that time, the level of tumor biomarkers and upper abdomen routine CT were unremarkable. We estimated the causality between liraglutide and pancreatic cancer by the Naranjo Adverse Drug Reaction Probability scale and WHO-Uppsala Monitoring Centre (WHO-UMC) system, and the causality turned out to be possible. CONCLUSION: Our report suggests that liraglutide may be related with the genesis and development of pancreatic cancer and also highlights the importance of regular checkups in diabetic patients treated with liraglutide. However, our report has some notable limitations, and further longer-term follow-up trials with larger sample should be conducted in future to assess the causality between liraglutide and pancreatic cancer.","Aged; Biopsy; Carcinoma, Pancreatic Ductal/*chemically induced/*complications/diagnostic imaging; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*complications; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents/*adverse effects/therapeutic use; Liraglutide/*adverse effects/therapeutic use; Lymphatic Metastasis; Male; Pancreas/diagnostic imaging/pathology; Pancreatic Neoplasms/*chemically induced/*complications/diagnostic imaging; Tomography, X-Ray Computed",Wu S; Wang J; Jing L; Chen L,Frontiers in endocrinology,2020,,Front Endocrinol (Lausanne). 2021 Jan 28;11:608966. doi: 10.3389/fendo.2020.608966. eCollection 2020.,Switzerland,347,7876378
34704841,Improving Palliative Care and Quality of Life in Pancreatic Cancer Patients.,"Background: Pancreatic cancer patients often present with complications, which can impact treatment tolerance. Thus, symptom management is a vital component of treatment in addition to traditional chemotherapeutics. Concurrent palliative care with an emphasis on aggressive symptom management may sustain both clinical and patient-centered outcomes during treatment. The purpose of this article is to explore the impact of a concurrent palliative care intervention in patients with pancreatic cancer treated on phase I clinical trials. Materials and Methods: This is a secondary analysis of a National Cancer Institute (NCI)-funded randomized trial of an advanced practice nurse driven palliative care intervention for solid tumor patients treated on phase I clinical trials. Only pancreatic cancer patients were included in the analysis. Patients received two educational sessions around the quality of life (QOL) domains and completed the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G), patient-reported outcomes version of the common terminology criteria for adverse events (PRO-CTCAE), and the psychological distress thermometer at baseline, 4 and 12 weeks. Mixed model with repeated measures analysis was used to explore outcomes by study arm. Results: Of the 479 patients accrued to the study, 42 were diagnosed with pancreatic cancer (26 intervention, 16 usual care). A trend toward improvement in the physical, social, emotional, and functional FACT-G QOL subscales and psychological distress (baseline to 12 weeks) were observed for the intervention arm. Patients reported moderate severity in psychological and physical stress. Conclusions: In this secondary analysis, a nurse-led palliative care intervention may improve the QOL and psychological distress of pancreatic cancer patients. A phase III trial focused on patients with pancreatic cancer is needed to determine the effectiveness of the intervention.",*Hospice and Palliative Care Nursing; Humans; Palliative Care/psychology; *Pancreatic Neoplasms/therapy; Quality of Life,Chung V; Sun V; Ruel N; Smith TJ; Ferrell BR,Journal of palliative medicine,2022,May,J Palliat Med. 2022 May;25(5):720-727. doi: 10.1089/jpm.2021.0187.

32176029,What is the relevance of an ambulatory quick diagnosis unit or inpatient admission for the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer? A retrospective study of 1004 patients.,"Quick diagnosis units (QDU) have become an alternative hospital-based ambulatory medicine strategy to inpatient hospitalization for potentially serious illnesses in Spain. Whether diagnosis of pancreatic cancer is better accomplished by an ambulatory or inpatient approach is unknown. The main objective of this retrospective study was to examine and compare the diagnostic effectiveness of a QDU or inpatient setting in patients with pancreatic cancer.Patients with a diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma who had been referred to a university, tertiary hospital-based QDU or hospitalized between 2005 and 2018 were eligible. Presenting symptoms and signs, risk and prognostic factors, and time to diagnosis were compared. The costs incurred during the diagnostic assessment were analyzed with a microcosting method.A total of 1004 patients (508 QDU patients and 496 inpatients) were eligible. Admitted patients were more likely than QDU patients to have weight loss, asthenia, anorexia, abdominal pain, jaundice, and palpable hepatomegaly. Time to diagnosis of inpatients was similar to that of QDU patients (4.1 [0.8 vs 4.3 [0.6] days; P = .163). Inpatients were more likely than QDU patients to have a tumor on the head of the pancreas, a tumor size >2 cm, a more advanced nodal stage, and a poorer histological differentiation. No differences were observed in the proportion of metastatic and locally advanced disease and surgical resections. Microcosting revealed a cost of &OV0556;347.76 (48.69) per QDU patient and &OV0556;634.36 (80.56) per inpatient (P < .001).Diagnosis of pancreatic cancer is similarly achieved by an inpatient or QDU clinical approach, but the latter seems to be cost-effective.

40361364,Unconventional Treatments for Pancreatic Cancer: A Systematic Review.,"OBJECTIVE: This study aims to review the existing literature on the efficacy and safety of unconventional treatments among pancreatic cancer patients, including the use of natural products, dietary supplements, probiotics, whole medical systems, and body-based therapies. METHODS: An electronic, systematic, and comprehensive literature review was conducted searching for studies up to November 2024 following the PRISMA 2020 guidelines. Randomized controlled trials and prospective and retrospective studies assessing the efficacy and safety of unconventional treatments for pancreatic cancer were considered eligible. Data on overall survival, quality of life, and treatment tolerability were extracted. RESULTS: A total of 21 studies, providing data from 3095 patients, met the inclusion criteria. Various types of unconventional treatments are used in pancreatic cancer patients, including Chinese herbal medicine (CHM), mistletoe extract (ME), curcumin, and electroacupuncture. Among these, the use of CHM and curcumin concomitant with standard therapy was associated with survival and quality-of-life benefits. Electroacupuncture reduced pancreatic cancer pain intensity in a cost-effective manner. The data on ME are mixed and of insufficient quality for drawing definitive conclusions. CONCLUSIONS: Some unconventional treatments showed potential benefits in improving overall survival and quality of life in pancreatic cancer patients within an integrative oncology setting.

32194310,A nomogram to preoperatively predict 1-year disease-specific survival in resected pancreatic cancer following neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy.,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop a nomogram to predict the 1-year survival of patients with pancreatic cancer who underwent pancreatectomy following neoadjuvant treatment with preoperatively detectable clinical parameters. Extended pancreatectomy is necessary to achieve complete tumor removal in borderline resectable and locally advanced pancreatic cancer. However, it increases postoperative morbidity and mortality rates, and should be balanced with potential benefit of long-term survival. METHODS: The medical records of patients who underwent pancreatectomy following neoadjuvant treatment from January 2005 to December 2016 at Severance Hospital were retrospectively reviewed. Medical records were collected from five international institutions from Japan and Singapore for external validation. RESULTS: A total of 113 patients were enrolled. The nomogram for predicting 1-year disease-specific survival was created based on 5 clinically detectable preoperative parameters as follows: age (year), symptom (no/yes), tumor size at initial diagnostic stage (cm), preoperative serum carbohydrate antigen (CA) 19-9 level after neoadjuvant treatment (<34/>/=34 U/mL), and planned surgery [pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) (pylorus-preserving PD)/distal pancreatectomy (DP)/total pancreatectomy]. Model performance was assessed for discrimination and calibration. The calibration plot showed good agreement between actual and predicted survival probabilities; the the Greenwood-Nam-D'Agostino (GND) goodness-of-fit test showed that the model was well calibrated (chi(2)=8.24, P=0.5099). A total of 84 patients were used for external validation. When correlating actual disease-specific survival and calculated 1-year disease-specific survival, there were significance differences according to the calculated probability of 1-year survival among the three groups (P=0.044). CONCLUSIONS: The developed nomogram had quite acceptable accuracy and clinical feasibility in the decision-making process for the management of pancreatic cancer.",,Hwang HK; Wada K; Kim HY; Nagakawa Y; Hijikata Y; Kawasaki Y; Nakamura Y; Lee LS; Yoon DS; Lee WJ; Kang CM,Chinese journal of cancer research = Chung-kuo yen cheng yen chiu,2020,Feb,Chin J Cancer Res. 2020 Feb;32(1):105-114. doi: 10.21147/j.issn.1000-9604.2020.01.12.,China,304,7072019
32594093,Irinotecan-Associated Dysarthria in Patients with Pancreatic Cancer: A Single Site Experience.,"BACKGROUND Irinotecan, a topoisomerase I inhibitor, is a cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agent used to treat multiple malignancies, including those of colorectal, pancreatic, cervical, esophageal, gastric, and lung origin. Dysarthria, a state of difficult or unclear articulation of speech, has been reported as a rare side effect of irinotecan through multiple case reports and case series, but with limited published data aimed at understanding the underlying mechanism and effective management strategies. CASE REPORT We describe herein 3 cases of patients with pancreatic malignancy who experienced dysarthria while being treated with a chemotherapy regimen containing irinotecan at an ambulatory outpatient satellite chemotherapy site. All patients described received first-line FOLFIRINOX for pancreatic cancer and experienced dysarthria during their first infusion of irinotecan. In all cases, dysarthria was observed as a transient adverse drug reaction within the first 10 to 70 min of irinotecan infusion, which resolved rapidly upon pausing infusion without any long-term sequalae. All patients remained conscious and alert; physical and neurological examinations at dysarthria onset revealed no abnormalities. Some patients experienced distal extremity paresthesia, a known manifestation of oxaliplatin-induced acute neurotoxicity, and diaphoresis and nausea. Increased infusion time effectively prevented dysarthria during subsequent infusions. CONCLUSIONS Oncologists, pharmacists, nurses, and other care team members should be aware that irinotecan-associated dysarthria is a rare, mild, and self-limiting phenomenon to avoid inadvertently altering or withholding therapy. We suggest extending irinotecan infusion time, as opposed to dose reduction or treatment discontinuation, as a practical clinical management strategy for patients who develop recurrent dysarthria secondary to irinotecan infusion.",Aged; Dysarthria/*chemically induced; Female; Humans; Irinotecan/*adverse effects; Middle Aged; Pancreatic Neoplasms/*drug therapy; Topoisomerase I Inhibitors/*adverse effects,Elbeddini A; Hooda N; Gazarin M; Webster P; McMillan J,The American journal of case reports,2020,Jun,Am J Case Rep. 2020 Jun 28;21:e924058. doi: 10.12659/AJCR.924058.,United States,406,7347036
25789286,Pancreatic cancer in an Asian population.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Most of the available data on pancreatic cancer are from Western countries. The aim was to characterize pancreatic cancer in Asian patients and to compare it with pancreatic cancer in Caucasians. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Inpatients with histologically proven pancreatic cancer were retrospectively recruited at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital from January 2005 to December 2011. RESULTS: The study enrolled 100 patients (male:female = 55:45, mean age 62.7 +/- 12.9 years). The amount of time between symptom onset and disease diagnosis was 59.89 +/- 63.12 days. The common presenting symptoms included abdominal pain or discomfort (71%), weight loss (70%), and jaundice (60%). Fifty-three of the 100 patients had stage 4 pancreatic cancer. The most common metastatic organ was the liver (n = 42, 79.25%). The survival rates after 1 and 3 years were 24 and 6%, respectively. The overall median time for survival was 5.1 months (range, 3 days to 62.4 months). According to the multivariate analysis, the staging at the time of diagnosis, serum albumin level, and tumor size were found to independently affect the survival rate. Twenty-two patients underwent endoscopic ultrasound-fine-needle aspiration with the sensitivity rate of 86.4% (19/22). CONCLUSION: Because pancreatic cancer in Asians may be clinically similar to the disease in Caucasians, the goals of future research of the disease may also be similar in the two populations.",,Kongkam P; Benjasupattananun P; Taytawat P; Navicharoen P; Sriuranpong V; Vajragupta L; Klaikaew N; Ridtitid W; Treeprasertsuk S; Rerknimitr R; Kullavanijaya P,Endoscopic ultrasound,2015,Jan-Mar,Endosc Ultrasound. 2015 Jan-Mar;4(1):56-62. doi: 10.4103/2303-9027.151361.,China,295,4362006
32513155,Chemopreventive effect of Betulinic acid via mTOR -Caspases/Bcl2/Bax apoptotic signaling in pancreatic cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Pancreatic cancer is aggressive with no symptoms until the advanced stage reached. The increased resistance of pancreatic cancer to chemotherapy demonstrates a dilemma in the clinical field. Hence, it is a matter of great urgency to develop an effective drug to treat patients with pancreatic cancer. Betulinic acid is a major triterpene isolated from spina date seed. Several studies have suggested its low toxicity and side effects to patients with malaria and inflammation. However, relevant studies on betulinic acid in inhibiting cancer were insufficient and the molecular mechanism was unclear. This study aimed to systematically explore the potential anti-cancer functions of betulinic acid in pancreatic cancer, and investigate its underlying molecular mechanism. METHODS: The Counting Kit-8 assay, colony formation, transwell invasion assay, wound healing assay, flow cytometry and xenograft nude mice model were used to evaluate the effect of betulinic acid on the proliferation, invasion and migration ability of pancreatic cancer cells. RESULTS: Our results showed that betulinic acid obviously suppressed pancreatic cancer both in vitro and in vivo in a dose-dependent manner. We also determined that betulinic acid inhibited pancreatic cancer by specifically targeting mTOR signaling rather than Nrf2 or JAK2. CONCLUSIONS: These findings clarify that betulinic acid is a potential and valuable anticancer agent for pancreatic cancer, and indicate the specific molecular target of betulinic acid.","Animals; Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology; *Apoptosis; Caspases/metabolism; Cell Line, Tumor; Disease Models, Animal; Humans; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Mice, Nude; Pancreatic Neoplasms/*drug therapy; Pentacyclic Triterpenes; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism; TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism; Triterpenes/*pharmacology; bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism; Betulinic Acid",Guo Y; Zhu H; Weng M; Wang C; Sun L,BMC complementary medicine and therapies,2020,Jun,BMC Complement Med Ther. 2020 Jun 8;20(1):178. doi: 10.1186/s12906-020-02976-7.,England,335,7282238

34993149,Advances in the Detection of Pancreatic Cancer Through Liquid Biopsy.,"Pancreatic cancer refers to the development of malignant tumors in the pancreas: it is associated with high mortality rates and mostly goes undetected in its early stages for lack of symptoms. Currently, surgical treatment is the only effective way to improve the survival of pancreatic cancer patients. Therefore, it is crucial to diagnose the disease as early as possible in order to improve the survival rate of patients with pancreatic cancer. Liquid biopsy is a unique in vitro diagnostic technique offering the advantage of earlier detection of tumors. Although liquid biopsies have shown promise for screening for certain cancers, whether they are effective for early diagnosis of pancreatic cancer is unclear.

34207699,Mechanistic Actions between Garcinia atroviridis Essential Oil and 2 Deoxy-d-glucose in Cultured PANC-1 Human Pancreatic Cancer Cells.,"Pancreatic cancer is an aggressive disease that progresses in a relatively symptom-free manner; thus, is difficult to detect and treat. Essential oil is reported to exhibit pharmacological properties, besides its common and well-known function as aromatherapy. Therefore, this study herein aimed to investigate the anti-proliferative effect of essential oil extracted from leaves of Garcinia atroviridis (EO-L) against PANC-1 human pancreatic cancer cell line. The cell growth inhibitory concentration at 50% (IC(50)) and selective index (SI) values of EO-L analyses were determined as 78 microg/mL and 1.23, respectively. Combination index (CI) analysis revealed moderate synergism (CI values of 0.36 to 0.75) between EO-L and 2 deoxy-d-glucose (2-DG) treatments. The treatments of PANC-1 cells with EO-L, 2-DG and EOL+2DG showed evidence of depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential, cell growth arrest and apoptosis. The molecular mechanism causing the anti-proliferative effect between EO-L and 2-DG is potentially through pronounced up-regulation of P53 (4.40-fold), HIF1alpha (1.92-fold), HK2 (2.88-fold) and down-regulation of CYP3A5 (0.11-fold), as supported by quantitative mRNA expression analysis. Collectively, the current data suggest that the combination of two anti-proliferative agents, EO-L and 2-DG, can potentially be explored as therapeutic treatments and as potentiating agents to conventional therapy against human pancreatic cancer.","Apoptosis/drug effects; Cell Line; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation/drug effects; Deoxyglucose/*pharmacology; Drug Synergism; Garcinia/*chemistry; Humans; Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial; Oils, Volatile/*pharmacology; Pancreatic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology; Plant Leaves/chemistry",Nik Mohamed Kamal NNS; Abdul Aziz FA; Tan WN; Fauzi AN; Lim V,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2021,Jun,Molecules. 2021 Jun 9;26(12):3518. doi: 10.3390/molecules26123518.,Switzerland,264,8227498

It often occurs in patients with immunodeficiency due to various factors, such as cancer, diabetes mellitus, and organ transplantation. The identification of gram-positive bacilli in septicemia, the presence of gas-forming liver damage and intravascular hemolysis are manifestations of Clostridium perfringens infection. The episode deteriorates rapidly and has a high mortality rate. CASE PRESENTATION: This case involved a 60-year-old man with infection onset 2 weeks after common bile duct stenting for obstructive jaundice caused by unresectable pancreatic cancer. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed gas-containing lesions in the liver. Blood culture showed Clostridium perfringens. Though aggressively rescued, he died within 24 hrs after admission.

The endoscopic ultrasound-guided biopsies of the pancreatic mass revealed no malignant cells and the pancreatic swelling had become diffuse on repeat imaging. AIP was suspected and a trial of steroids was considered as a diagnostic and therapeutic method. The patient responded dramatically to corticosteroid treatment with resolution of symptoms and normal imagining and laboratory parameters. This case highlights the challenge in the diagnostic approach of a pancreatic mass.,,Cazacu IM; Chavez AAL; Saftoiu A; Whitlow TG; Bhosale P; Bhutani MS,Current health sciences journal,2018,Apr-Jun,Curr Health Sci J. 2018 Apr-Jun;44(2):181-185. doi: 10.12865/CHSJ.44.02.15.

34785894,Emodin-Conjugated PEGylation of Fe(3)O(4) Nanoparticles for FI/MRI Dual-Modal Imaging and Therapy in Pancreatic Cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Pancreatic cancer (PC) remains a difficult tumor to diagnose and treat. It is often diagnosed as advanced by reason of the anatomical structure of the deep retroperitoneal layer of the pancreas, lack of typical symptoms and effective screening methods to detect this malignancy, resulting in a low survival rate. Emodin (EMO) is an economical natural product with effective treatment and few side effects of cancer treatment. Magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) can achieve multiplexed imaging and targeted therapy by loading a wide range of functional materials such as fluorescent dyes and therapeutic agents. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to design and evaluate a multifunctional theranostic nanoplatform for PC diagnosis and treatment. METHODS: In this study, we successfully developed EMO-loaded, Cy7-functionalized, PEG-coated Fe(3)O(4) (Fe(3)O(4)-PEG-Cy7-EMO). Characteristics including morphology, hydrodynamic size, zeta potentials, stability, and magnetic properties of Fe(3)O(4)-PEG-Cy7-EMO were evaluated. Fluorescence imaging (FI)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and therapeutic treatment were examined in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS: Fe(3)O(4)-PEG-Cy7-EMO nanoparticles had a core size of 9.9 +/- 1.2 nm, which showed long-time stability and FI/MRI properties. Bio-transmission electron microscopy (bio-TEM) results showed that Fe(3)O(4)-PEG-Cy7-EMO nanoparticles were endocytosed into BxPC-3 cells, while few were observed in hTERT-HPNE cells. Prussian blue staining also confirmed that BxPC-3 cells have a stronger phagocytic ability as compared to hTERT-HPNE cells. Additionally, Fe(3)O(4)-PEG-Cy7-EMO had a stronger inhibition effect on BxPC-3 cells than Fe(3)O(4)-PEG and EMO. The hemolysis experiment proved that Fe(3)O(4)-PEG-Cy7-EMO can be used in vivo experiments. In vivo analysis demonstrated that Fe(3)O(4)-PEG-Cy7-EMO enabled FI/MRI dual-modal imaging and targeted therapy in pancreatic tumor xenografted mice. CONCLUSION: Fe(3)O(4)-PEG-Cy7-EMO may serve as a potential theranostic nanoplatform for PC.","Animals; Cell Line, Tumor; *Emodin/pharmacology; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; *Magnetite Nanoparticles; Mice; *Nanoparticles; Optical Imaging; *Pancreatic Neoplasms/diagnostic imaging/drug therapy",Ren S; Song L; Tian Y; Zhu L; Guo K; Zhang H; Wang Z,International journal of nanomedicine,2021,,Int J Nanomedicine. 2021 Nov 6;16:7463-7478. doi: 10.2147/IJN.S335588. eCollection 2021.,New Zealand,272,8579871
23590467,Dimethylaminoparthenolide and gemcitabine: a survival study using a genetically engineered mouse model of pancreatic cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Pancreatic cancer remains one of the deadliest cancers due to lack of early detection and absence of effective treatments. Gemcitabine, the current standard-of-care chemotherapy for pancreatic cancer, has limited clinical benefit. Treatment of pancreatic cancer cells with gemcitabine has been shown to induce the activity of the transcription factor nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) which regulates the expression of genes involved in the inflammatory response and tumorigenesis. It has therefore been proposed that gemcitabine-induced NF-kappaB activation may result in chemoresistance. We hypothesize that NF-kappaB suppression by the novel inhibitor dimethylaminoparthenolide (DMAPT) may enhance the effect of gemcitabine in pancreatic cancer. METHODS: The efficacy of DMAPT and gemcitabine was evaluated in a chemoprevention trial using the mutant Kras and p53-expressing LSL-KrasG12D/+; LSL-Trp53R172H; Pdx-1-Cre mouse model of pancreatic cancer. Mice were randomized to treatment groups (placebo, DMAPT [40 mg/kg/day], gemcitabine [50 mg/kg twice weekly], and the combination DMAPT/gemcitabine). Treatment was continued until mice showed signs of ill health at which time they were sacrificed. Plasma cytokine levels were determined using a Bio-Plex immunoassay. Statistical tests used included log-rank test, ANOVA with Dunnett's post-test, Student's t-test, and Fisher exact test. RESULTS: Gemcitabine or the combination DMAPT/gemcitabine significantly increased median survival and decreased the incidence and multiplicity of pancreatic adenocarcinomas. The DMAPT/gemcitabine combination also significantly decreased tumor size and the incidence of metastasis to the liver. No significant differences in the percentages of normal pancreatic ducts or premalignant pancreatic lesions were observed between the treatment groups. Pancreata in which no tumors formed were analyzed to determine the extent of pre-neoplasia; mostly normal ducts or low grade pancreatic lesions were observed, suggesting prevention of higher grade lesions in these animals. While gemcitabine treatment increased the levels of the inflammatory cytokines interleukin 1alpha (IL-1alpha), IL-1beta, and IL-17 in mouse plasma, DMAPT and DMAPT/gemcitabine reduced the levels of the inflammatory cytokines IL-12p40, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), macrophage inflammatory protein-1 beta (MIP-1beta), eotaxin, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), all of which are NF-kappaB target genes. CONCLUSION: In summary, these findings provide preclinical evidence supporting further evaluation of agents such as DMAPT and gemcitabine for the prevention and treatment of pancreatic cancer.","Adenocarcinoma/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology; Animals; Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use; Cytokines/blood; Deoxycytidine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives; Disease Models, Animal; Immunohistochemistry; Mice; Mice, Mutant Strains; NF-kappa B/antagonists & inhibitors; Pancreatic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology; Sesquiterpenes/administration & dosage; Gemcitabine",Yip-Schneider MT; Wu H; Stantz K; Agaram N; Crooks PA; Schmidt CM,BMC cancer,2013,Apr,BMC Cancer. 2013 Apr 17;13:194. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-13-194.,England,555,3672012
30691417,"Timing of palliative care referral and aggressive cancer care toward the end-of-life in pancreatic cancer: a retrospective, single-center observational study.","BACKGROUND: Pancreatic cancer is noted for its late presentation at diagnosis, limited prognosis and physical and psychosocial symptom burden. This study examined associations between timing of palliative care referral (PCR) and aggressive cancer care received by pancreatic cancer patients in the last 30 days of life through a single health service. METHOD: A retrospective cohort analysis of end-of-life (EOL) care outcomes of patients with pancreatic cancer who died between 2012 and 2016. Key indicators of aggressive cancer care in the last 30 days of life used were: >/=1 emergency department (ED) presentations, acute inpatient/intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and chemotherapy use. We examined time from PCR to death and place of death. Early and late PCR were defined as > 90 and </= 90 days before death respectively. RESULTS: Out of the 278 eligible deaths, 187 (67.3%) were categorized as receiving a late PCR and 91 (32.7%) an early PCR. The median time between referral and death was 48 days. Compared to those receiving early PCR, those with late PCR had: 18.1% (95% CI 6.8-29.4%) more ED presentations; 12.5% (95% CI 1.7-24.8%) more acute hospital admissions; with no differences in ICU admissions. Pain and complications of cancer accounted for the majority of overall ED presentations. Of the 166 patients who received chemotherapy within 30 days of death, 23 (24.5%) had a late PCR and 12 (16.7%) an early PCR, with no association of PCR status either unadjusted or adjusted for age or gender. The majority of patients (55.8%) died at the inpatient palliative care unit. CONCLUSION: Our findings reaffirm the benefits of early PCR for pancreatic cancer patients to avoid inappropriate care toward the EOL. We suggest that in modern cancer care, there can sometimes be a need to reconsider the use of the term 'aggressive cancer care' at the EOL when the care is appropriately based on an individual patient's presenting physical and psychosocial needs. Pancreatic cancer patients warrant early PCR but the debate must thus continue as to how we best achieve and benchmark outcomes that are compatible with patient and family needs and healthcare priorities.",Aged; Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use; Female; Humans; Male; Palliative Care/*organization & administration; Pancreatic Neoplasms/*therapy; Referral and Consultation/organization & administration; Retrospective Studies; Terminal Care/*organization & administration; Time-to-Treatment; Treatment Outcome; Victoria,Michael N; Beale G; O'Callaghan C; Melia A; DeSilva W; Costa D; Kissane D; Shapiro J; Hiscock R,BMC palliative care,2019,Jan,BMC Palliat Care. 2019 Jan 28;18(1):13. doi: 10.1186/s12904-019-0399-4.,England,675,6350289
36916724,"Early Diagnosis of Pancreatic Cancer: Clinical Premonitions, Timely Precursor Detection and Increased Curative-Intent Surgery.","BACKGROUND: The overall poor prognosis in pancreatic cancer is related to late clinical detection. Early diagnosis remains a considerable challenge in pancreatic cancer. Unfortunately, the onset of clinical symptoms in patients usually indicate advanced disease or presence of metastasis. ANALYSIS AND RESULTS: Currently, there are no designated diagnostic or screening tests for pancreatic cancer in clinical use. Thus, identifying risk groups, preclinical risk factors or surveillance strategies to facilitate early detection is a target for ongoing research. Hereditary genetic syndromes are a obvious, but small group at risk, and warrants close surveillance as suggested by society guidelines. Screening for pancreatic cancer in asymptomatic individuals is currently associated with the risk of false positive tests and, thus, risk of harms that outweigh benefits. The promise of cancer biomarkers and use of 'omics' technology (genomic, transcriptomics, metabolomics etc.) has yet to see a clinical breakthrough. Several proposed biomarker studies for early cancer detection lack external validation or, when externally validated, have shown considerably lower accuracy than in the original data. Biopsies or tissues are often taken at the time of diagnosis in research studies, hence invalidating the value of a time-dependent lag of the biomarker to detect a pre-clinical, asymptomatic yet operable cancer. New technologies will be essential for early diagnosis, with emerging data from image-based radiomics approaches, artificial intelligence and machine learning suggesting avenues for improved detection. CONCLUSIONS: Early detection may come from analytics of various body fluids (eg 'liquid biopsies' from blood or urine). In this review we present some the technological platforms that are explored for their ability to detect pancreatic cancer, some of which may eventually change the prospects and outcomes of patients with pancreatic cancer.",Humans; *Early Detection of Cancer; Artificial Intelligence; *Pancreatic Neoplasms/diagnosis/surgery/genetics; Risk Factors,Soreide K; Ismail W; Roalso M; Ghotbi J; Zaharia C,Cancer control : journal of the Moffitt Cancer Center,2023,Jan-Dec,Cancer Control. 2023 Jan-Dec;30:10732748231154711. doi: 10.1177/10732748231154711.,United States,425,9893084
36230607,Risk Factors for Pancreatic Cancer in Patients with New-Onset Diabetes: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"(1) Background: Patients with new-onset diabetes (NOD) are at risk of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), but the most relevant additional risk factors and clinical characteristics are not well established. (2) Objectives: To compare the risk for PDAC in NOD patients to persons without diabetes. Identify risk factors of PDAC among NOD patients. (3) Methods: Medline, Embase, and Google Scholar were last searched in June 2022 for observational studies on NOD patients and assessing risk factors for developing PDAC. Data were extracted, and Meta-Analysis was performed. Pooled effect sizes with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated with DerSimonian & Laird random effects models. (4) Findings: Twenty-two studies were included, and 576,210 patients with NOD contributed to the analysis, of which 3560 had PDAC. PDAC cases were older than controls by 6.14 years (CI 3.64-8.65, 11 studies). The highest risk of PDAC involved a family history of PDAC (3.78, CI 2.03-7.05, 4 studies), pancreatitis (5.66, CI 2.75-11.66, 9 studies), cholecystitis (2.5, CI 1.4-4.45, 4 studies), weight loss (2.49, CI 1.47-4.22, 4 studies), and high/rapidly increasing glycemia (2.33, CI 1.85-2.95, 4 studies) leading to more insulin use (4.91, CI 1.62-14.86, 5 studies). Smoking (ES 1.20, CI 1.03-1.41, 9 studies) and alcohol (ES 1.23, CI 1.09-1.38, 9 studies) have a smaller effect. (5) Conclusion: Important risk factors for PDAC among NOD patients are age, family history, and gallstones/pancreatitis. Symptoms are weight loss and rapid increase in glycemia. The identified risk factors could be used to develop a diagnostic model to screen NOD patients.",,Mellenthin C; Balaban VD; Dugic A; Cullati S,Cancers,2022,Sep,Cancers (Basel). 2022 Sep 26;14(19):4684. doi: 10.3390/cancers14194684.,Switzerland,1076,9563634
28656074,Detecting circulating tumor material and digital pathology imaging during pancreatic cancer progression.,"Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Clinical symptoms typically present late when treatment options are limited and survival expectancy is very short. Metastatic mutations are heterogeneous and can accumulate up to twenty years before PC diagnosis. Given such genetic diversity, detecting and managing the complex states of disease progression may be limited to imaging modalities and markers present in circulation. Recent developments in digital pathology imaging show potential for early PC detection, making a differential diagnosis, and predicting treatment sensitivity leading to long-term survival in advanced stage patients. Despite large research efforts, the only serum marker currently approved for clinical use is CA 19-9. Utility of CA 19-9 has been shown to improve when it is used in combination with PC-specific markers. Efforts are being made to develop early-screening assays that can detect tumor-derived material, present in circulation, before metastasis takes a significant course. Detection of markers that identify circulating tumor cells and tumor-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) in biofluid samples offers a promising non-invasive method for this purpose. Circulating tumor cells exhibit varying expression of epithelial and mesenchymal markers depending on the state of tumor differentiation. This offers a possibility for monitoring disease progression using minimally invasive procedures. EVs also offer the benefit of detecting molecular cargo of tumor origin and add the potential to detect circulating vesicle markers from tumors that lack invasive properties. This review integrates recent genetic insights of PC progression with developments in digital pathology and early detection of tumor-derived circulating material.",,Moravec R; Divi R; Verma M,World journal of gastrointestinal oncology,2017,Jun,World J Gastrointest Oncol. 2017 Jun 15;9(6):235-250. doi: 10.4251/wjgo.v9.i6.235.,China,505,5472554
26844499,Vertebral Compression Fracture Related to Pancreatic Cancer With Osteoblastic Metastasis: A Case Report and Literature Review.,"Compression fracture of the vertebral body is common in the older patients. The possible etiology like osteoporosis or cancer metastasis should be included as a possibility in the differential diagnosis for severe back pain, to prevent delays in diagnosis and treatment. More severe fractures can cause significant pain, leading to inability to perform activities of daily living, and life-threatening in the older patient.We report a rare case of a 61-year-old man suffering from severe lower back pain and intermittent abdominal fullness. He came to our clinic, where muscle power was normal, but could not stand up or change posture because of severe back pain. Plain film and magnetic resonance imaging of lumbar spine both revealed osteoblastic lesion at L2 spine. Abdomen computed tomography showed a mass at the pancreatic body. The pancreatic cancer with osteoblastic metastasis was diagnosed. After receiving multimodality therapy such as percutaneous vertebroplasty and pain controlling, we provided effective palliation of symptoms, aggressive rehabilitation program, and better quality of life.Our case highlights the benefits of multidisciplinary cancer treatment for such patient, preventing the complications such as immobilization accompanied with adverse effects like musculoskeletal, respiratory, and cardiovascular systems.

39369582,"A randomized trial of pharmacological ascorbate, gemcitabine, and nab-paclitaxel for metastatic pancreatic cancer.","BACKGROUND: Patients with metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) have poor 5-year survival. Pharmacological ascorbate (P-AscH(-), high dose, intravenous, vitamin C) has shown promise as an adjunct to chemotherapy. We hypothesized adding P-AscH(-) to gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel would increase survival in patients with metastatic PDAC. METHODS: Patients diagnosed with stage IV pancreatic cancer randomized 1:1 to gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel only (SOC, control) or to SOC with concomitant P-AscH(-), 75 g three times weekly (ASC, investigational). The primary outcome was overall survival with secondary objectives of determining progression-free survival and adverse event incidence. Quality of life and patient reported outcomes for common oncologic symptoms were captured as an exploratory objective. Thirty-six participants were randomized; of this 34 received their assigned study treatment. All analyses were based on data frozen on December 11, 2023. RESULTS: Intravenous P-AscH(-) increased serum ascorbate levels from micromolar to millimolar levels. P-AscH(-) added to the gemcitabine + nab-paclitaxel (ASC) increased overall survival to 16 months compared to 8.3 months with gemcitabine + nab-paclitaxel (SOC) (HR = 0.46; 90 % CI 0.23, 0.92; p = 0.030). Median progression free survival was 6.2 (ASC) vs. 3.9 months (SOC) (HR = 0.43; 90 % CI 0.20, 0.92; p = 0.029). Adding P-AscH(-) did not negatively impact quality of life or increase the frequency or severity of adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: P-AscH(-) infusions of 75 g three times weekly in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer prolongs overall and progression free survival without detriment to quality of life or added toxicity (ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT02905578).","Adult; Aged; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Albumins/administration & dosage/therapeutic use/adverse effects; *Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use/adverse effects; *Ascorbic Acid/therapeutic use/administration & dosage; Carcinoma, Pancreatic Ductal/drug therapy/pathology/mortality; Deoxycytidine/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use/administration & dosage; *Gemcitabine; Neoplasm Metastasis; *Paclitaxel/administration & dosage/therapeutic use/adverse effects; *Pancreatic Neoplasms/drug therapy/pathology/mortality; Quality of Life",Bodeker KL; Smith BJ; Berg DJ; Chandrasekharan C; Sharif S; Fei N; Vollstedt S; Brown H; Chandler M; Lorack A; McMichael S; Wulfekuhle J; Wagner BA; Buettner GR; Allen BG; Caster JM; Dion B; Kamgar M; Buatti JM; Cullen JJ,Redox biology,2024,Nov,Redox Biol. 2024 Nov;77:103375. doi: 10.1016/j.redox.2024.103375.

24212790,Endoscopic palliation for pancreatic cancer.,"Pancreatic cancer is devastating due to its poor prognosis. Patients require a multidisciplinary approach to guide available options, mostly palliative because of advanced disease at presentation. Palliation including relief of biliary obstruction, gastric outlet obstruction, and cancer-related pain has become the focus in patients whose cancer is determined to be unresectable. Endoscopic stenting for biliary obstruction is an option for drainage to avoid the complications including jaundice, pruritus, infection, liver dysfunction and eventually failure. Enteral stents can relieve gastric obstruction and allow patients to resume oral intake. Pain is difficult to treat in cancer patients and endoscopic procedures such as pancreatic stenting and celiac plexus neurolysis can provide relief.

31736256,Are population-based patient-reported outcomes associated with overall survival in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer?,"BACKGROUND: Advanced pancreatic cancer (APC) patients often have substantial symptom burden. In Ontario, patients routinely complete the Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS), which screens for nine symptoms (scale: 0-10), in cancer clinics. We explored the association between baseline patient-reported outcomes, via ESAS, and overall survival (OS). METHODS: Advanced pancreatic cancer patients with ESAS records prior to receiving publicly funded drugs from November 2008 to March 2016 were retrospectively identified from Cancer Care Ontario's administrative databases. We examined three composite ESAS scores: total symptom distress score (TSDS: 9 symptoms), physical symptom score (PHS: 6/9 symptoms), and psychological symptom score (PSS: 2/9 symptoms); Composite scores greater than defined thresholds (TSDS >/=36, PHS >/=24, PSS >/=8) were considered as high symptom burden. Crude OS was assessed using Kaplan-Meier method. Hazard ratios (HRs) were assessed using multivariable Cox models. Analysis was repeated in a sub-cohort with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) status and metastasis. RESULTS: We identified 2199 APC patients (mean age 64 years, 55% male) with ESAS records prior to receiving chemotherapy. Crude median survival was 4.5 and 7.3 months for high and low TSDS, respectively. High TSDS was associated with lower OS (HR = 1.47, 95% CI: 1.33, 1.63). In the sub-cohort (n = 393) with ECOG status and metastasis, high TSDS was also associated with lower OS (HR = 1.34, 95% CI: 1.04, 1.73). Similar trends were observed for PHS and PSS. CONCLUSIONS: Higher burden of patient-reported outcome was associated with reduced OS among APC patients. The effect was prominent after adjusting for ECOG status.","Administrative Claims, Healthcare/statistics & numerical data; Aged; Databases, Factual/statistics & numerical data; Female; Humans; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Staging; Ontario/epidemiology; Pancreatic Neoplasms/diagnosis/*mortality; *Patient Reported Outcome Measures; Prognosis; Retrospective Studies; *Severity of Illness Index; Symptom Assessment/methods/*statistics & numerical data",Dai WF; Beca J; Guo H; Isaranawatchai W; Schwartz D; Naipaul R; Arias J; Qiao Y; Gavura S; Redmond-Misner R; Ismail Z; Barbera L; Chan K,Cancer medicine,2020,Jan,Cancer Med. 2020 Jan;9(1):215-224. doi: 10.1002/cam4.2704.

31699117,Untypical autoimmune pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer: differential diagnosis experiences extracted from misdiagnose of two cases.,"BACKGROUND: Differentiation between pancreatic cancer (PC) and focal form of autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP) is very challenging, with similar clinical presentations, laboratory results and morphologic imagings of US, CT, EUS, MRI, ERCP, PET-CT. Even serum IgG4 and biopsy sometimes cannot give clear-cut differential accurate diagnostis. Considering the totally different management strategy of the two diseases, accurate diagnostic value is urgently needed to remind the clinicians of the rare diagnosis of untypical AIP among frequent PC-suspected patients. RESULTS: We present 2 laparotomy cases of AIP that had a high similar characteristic to PC and retrospectively extracted the warning signs that may help select untypical AIP in PC-suspected patients. CONCLUSIONS: We find that mild fluctuating jaundice with abdominal pain, young age, tumor marker of TPS, TPA and diverse results between variable radiological tests can help to differentiate AIP mass from PC, through retrospectively analyzing work-up process of AIP in two patients who underwent laparotomy for suspected PC.","Adult; Autoimmune Pancreatitis/*diagnosis/immunology; Biopsy; *Diagnosis, Differential; Female; Humans; Immunoglobulin G/metabolism; Middle Aged; Pancreatic Neoplasms/*diagnosis/immunology",Li G; Liu T; Zheng J; Kang W; Xu J; Gao Z; Ma J,Orphanet journal of rare diseases,2019,Nov,Orphanet J Rare Dis. 2019 Nov 7;14(1):245. doi: 10.1186/s13023-019-1217-z.,England,265,6839088
35722628,Integrated Analysis of ECT2 and COL17A1 as Potential Biomarkers for Pancreatic Cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a malignant tumor of the digestive tract. It presents with atypical clinical symptoms and lacks specific diagnostic indicators. This study is aimed at exploring the potential biomarkers of PC. METHODS: TCGA database pancreatic cancer dataset was normalized and used to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Survival, independent prognostic, and clinical correlation analyses were performed on DEGs to screen for key genes. DNA methylation, mutation, and copy number variation (CNV) analyses were used to analyze genetic variants in key genes. GSEA was performed to explore the functional enrichment of the key genes. Based on the expression of key genes, construction of a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network, analysis of the tumor microenvironment (TME), and prediction of chemotherapeutic drug sensitivity were performed. Furthermore, the GEO database was used to validate the reliability of key genes. RESULTS: Two key genes (ECT2 and COL17A1) were identified, which were highly expressed in PC. The mRNA expression of ECT2 and COL17A1 was associated with DNA methylation and CNV. The cell cycle, proteasome, and pathways in cancer were enriched in the high-COL17A1 and ECT2 groups. The TME results showed that immune scores were decreased in the high-ECT2 group. CeRNA network results showed that there were eleven miRNAs were involved in the regulation of ECT2 and COL17A1. Moreover, pRRophetic analysis showed that 20 chemotherapeutic drugs were associated with ECT2 and COL17A1 expression. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, ECT2 and COL17A1 may be potential biomarkers for PC, providing a new direction for clinical diagnosis and treatment.","Biomarkers; Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics; DNA Copy Number Variations; *Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; *Pancreatic Neoplasms/pathology; Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics; Reproducibility of Results; Tumor Microenvironment/genetics",Huang WL; Wu SF; Huang X; Zhou S,Disease markers,2022,,Dis Markers. 2022 Jun 8;2022:9453549. doi: 10.1155/2022/9453549. eCollection 2022.,United States,264,9200569

38725864,LncRNAs as nodes for the cross-talk between autophagy and Wnt signaling in pancreatic cancer drug resistance.,"Pancreatic cancer is a malignancy with high mortality. In addition to the few symptoms until the disease reaches an advanced stage, the high fatality rate is attributed to its rapid development, drug resistance and lack of appropriate treatment. In the selection and research of therapeutic drugs, gemcitabine is the first-line drug for pancreatic cancer. Solving the problem of gemcitabine resistance in pancreatic cancer will contribute to the progress of pancreatic cancer treatment. Long non coding RNAs (lncRNAs), which are RNA transcripts longer than 200 nucleotides, play vital roles in cellular physiological metabolic activities. Currently, our group and others have found that some lncRNAs are aberrantly expressed in pancreatic cancer cells, which can regulate the process of cancer through autophagy and Wnt/beta-catenin pathways simultaneously and affect the sensitivity of cancer cells to therapeutic drugs. This review presents an overview of the recent evidence concerning the node of lncRNA for the cross-talk between autophagy and Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in pancreatic cancer, together with the practicability of lncRNAs and the core regulatory factors as targets in therapeutic resistance.","*RNA, Long Noncoding/metabolism/genetics; Humans; *Autophagy/drug effects; *Pancreatic Neoplasms/metabolism/drug therapy/genetics; *Wnt Signaling Pathway; *Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics; Animals",Huang Y; Zhang R; Lyu H; Xiao S; Guo D; Chen XZ; Zhou C; Tang J,International journal of biological sciences,2024,,Int J Biol Sci. 2024 Apr 29;20(7):2698-2726. doi: 10.7150/ijbs.91832. eCollection 2024.,Australia,327,11077374

32913288,Controlled coupling of an ultrapotent auristatin warhead to cetuximab yields a next-generation antibody-drug conjugate for EGFR-targeted therapy of KRAS mutant pancreatic cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) construction poses numerous challenges that limit clinical progress. In particular, common bioconjugation methods afford minimal control over the site of drug coupling to antibodies. Here, such difficulties are overcome through re-bridging of the inter-chain disulfides of cetuximab (CTX) with auristatin-bearing pyridazinediones, to yield a highly refined anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) ADC. METHODS: In vitro and in vivo assessment of ADC activity was performed in KRAS mutant pancreatic cancer (PaCa) models with known resistance to CTX therapy. Computational modelling was employed for quantitative prediction of tumour response to various ADC dosing regimens. RESULTS: Site-selective coupling of an auristatin to CTX yielded an ADC with an average drug:antibody ratio (DAR) of 3.9, which elicited concentration- and EGFR-dependent cytotoxicity at sub-nanomolar potency in vitro. In human xenografts, the ADC inhibited tumour growth and prolonged survival, with no overt signs of toxicity. Key insights into factors governing ADC efficacy were obtained through a robust mathematical framework, including target-mediated dispositional effects relating to antigen density on tumour cells. CONCLUSIONS: Together, our findings offer renewed hope for CTX in PaCa therapy, demonstrating that it may be reformatted as a next-generation ADC and combined with a predictive modelling tool to guide successful translation.","Aminobenzoates/*administration & dosage/chemistry; Animals; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics; Cetuximab/*administration & dosage/chemistry; Drugs, Investigational/chemical synthesis/therapeutic use; ErbB Receptors/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/immunology; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects; Humans; *Immunoconjugates/chemistry/therapeutic use; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, SCID; Mice, Transgenic; Molecular Targeted Therapy/methods; Mutation; Oligopeptides/*administration & dosage/chemistry; Pancreatic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology; Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)/genetics; Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays",Greene MK; Chen T; Robinson E; Straubinger NL; Minx C; Chan DKW; Wang J; Burrows JF; Van Schaeybroeck S; Baker JR; Caddick S; Longley DB; Mager DE; Straubinger RM; Chudasama V; Scott CJ,British journal of cancer,2020,Nov,Br J Cancer. 2020 Nov;123(10):1502-1512. doi: 10.1038/s41416-020-01046-6.

39205701,Pancreatic Cancer: A Retrospective Study From the Najran Region of Saudi Arabia.,"BACKGROUND: Despite advances in treatment, pancreatic cancer frequently has a low survival rate due to its advanced-stage diagnosis. Treatment focuses on prolonging survival and maintaining quality of life. This study investigates the characteristics associated with survival in advanced pancreatic cancer patients treated at a single academic cancer center in Najran, Saudi Arabia. METHOD: A retrospective chart review study covering the period January 1, 2015, and December 31, 2023, involved 80 adult patients with pathologically confirmed pancreatic cancer (ductal adenocarcinoma) at King Khalid Hospital in Najran, Saudi Arabia. Clinicopathological characteristics, therapy, response, and survival outcomes were all gathered and analyzed. The chi-squared test, Kaplan-Meier, and Cox proportional hazards method with hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used for statistical analysis. RESULT: The mean age was 65.7+/-14.1 years and 54 (67.5%) cases were male. The main symptom was abdominal pain (n=54, 67.5%), while jaundice was presented in 17 (21.2%) of cases. The baseline serum carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9) level varied among cases, with 35 (43.8%) having normal levels. The majority of cases (n=59, 73.8%) had distant metastases at the initial presentation, while 12 cases (15%) had localized disease (resectable), and 22 (27.5%) were locally advanced at the first presentation. The most commonly reported pathologic grade was poorly differentiated ductal adenocarcinoma in 39 (48.8%). FOLFIRINOX was used as first-line chemotherapy in 54 (67.5%) cases, while gemcitabine alone was used in 15 (18.8%) cases. First-line chemotherapy resulted in progressive disease in 30 (37.5%), stable disease in 30 (37.5%), and partial response in 14 (17.5%). With a mean follow-up time of 14.8+/-8.6 months, 57 (71.2%) were dead, where the main cause of death was disease progression (n=51, 89.5%). The median overall survival was 13.5 months, with a 12-month survival rate of 56% and a 36-month survival rate of 17%. The median cancer-specific survival was 16 months (95% CI: 13-22 months). The 12-month median cancer-specific survival was 61% (95% CI: 51-73%), and the 36-month median cancer-specific survival was 19% (95% CI: 10-34%). In univariate analysis, initial metastasis presentation (HR: 35.46; 95% CI: 4.90-256.83, p<0.001), poor Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG-PS) (3-4) (HR: 2.34; 95% CI:1.34-4.09, p=0.003), and presence of multiple metastases (HR: 1.33; 95% CI: 1.09-1.62, p=0.004) were associated with worsened survival. Patients who received the first chemotherapy were associated with better survival (HR: 0.53; 95% CI: 0.29-0.98, p=0.043). Furthermore, the response rate in patients who received FOLFIRINOX was better than that of those who received gemcitabine alone, which was statistically significant (p=0.002). CONCLUSION: Our study showed that initial metastatic presentation, poor ECOG-PS, and the occurrence of numerous metastases were all linked with poor survival of patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Additionally, FOLFIRINOX as a first-line treatment showed better survival rates than gemcitabine alone.

28105071,"An Australasian perspective on the curative treatment of patients with pancreatic cancer, supportive care, and future directions for management.","The management of patients with pancreatic cancer requires an individualised approach and the support of a multidisciplinary team to accurately stage patients and determine their suitability for curative treatment. Guidelines have been developed in Australasia to define the operability for patients who have been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. This is supported by advances in pancreatic cancer genetics, which show potential for developing targeted therapies for pancreatic cancer. Both surgery and targeted therapies aim to extend the overall survival of patients. Patients who are cured of their cancer may live with permanent changes in gut anatomy and physiology leading to distressing symptoms that may not be addressed. Patients who cannot be cured of pancreatic cancer may have supportive care issues that are often complex, and a strategic approach to manage these needs for patients with pancreatic cancer is underdeveloped in Australasia.

26055177,Imaging and Therapy of Pancreatic Cancer with Phosphatidylserine-Targeted Nanovesicles.,"Pancreatic cancer remains one of the most intractable cancers, with a dismal prognosis reflected by a 5-year survival of ~6%. Since early disease symptoms are undefined and specific biomarkers are lacking, about 80% of patients present with advanced, inoperable tumors that represent a daunting challenge. Despite many clinical trials, no single chemotherapy agent has been reliably associated with objective response rates above 10% or median survival longer than 5 to 7 months. Although combination chemotherapy regimens have in recent years provided some improvement, overall survival (8-11 months) remains very poor. There is therefore a critical need for novel therapies that can improve outcomes for pancreatic cancer patients. Here, we present a summary of the current therapies used in the management of advanced pancreatic cancer and review novel therapeutic strategies that target tumor biomarkers. We also describe our recent research using phosphatidylserine-targeted saposin C-coupled dioleoylphosphatidylserine nanovesicles for imaging and therapy of pancreatic cancer.",,Blanco VM; Latif T; Chu Z; Qi X,Translational oncology,2015,Jun,Transl Oncol. 2015 Jun;8(3):196-203. doi: 10.1016/j.tranon.2015.03.011.,United States,446,4486738
34077433,Can we screen for pancreatic cancer? Identifying a sub-population of patients at high risk of subsequent diagnosis using machine learning techniques applied to primary care data.,"BACKGROUND: Pancreatic cancer (PC) represents a substantial public health burden. Pancreatic cancer patients have very low survival due to the difficulty of identifying cancers early when the tumour is localised to the site of origin and treatable. Recent progress has been made in identifying biomarkers for PC in the blood and urine, but these cannot be used for population-based screening as this would be prohibitively expensive and potentially harmful. METHODS: We conducted a case-control study using prospectively-collected electronic health records from primary care individually-linked to cancer registrations. Our cases were comprised of 1,139 patients, aged 15-99 years, diagnosed with pancreatic cancer between January 1, 2005 and June 30, 2009. Each case was age-, sex- and diagnosis time-matched to four non-pancreatic (cancer patient) controls. Disease and prescription codes for the 24 months prior to diagnosis were used to identify 57 individual symptoms. Using a machine learning approach, we trained a logistic regression model on 75% of the data to predict patients who later developed PC and tested the model's performance on the remaining 25%. RESULTS: We were able to identify 41.3% of patients < = 60 years at 'high risk' of developing pancreatic cancer up to 20 months prior to diagnosis with 72.5% sensitivity, 59% specificity and, 66% AUC. 43.2% of patients >60 years were similarly identified at 17 months, with 65% sensitivity, 57% specificity and, 61% AUC. We estimate that combining our algorithm with currently available biomarker tests could result in 30 older and 400 younger patients per cancer being identified as 'potential patients', and the earlier diagnosis of around 60% of tumours. CONCLUSION: After further work this approach could be applied in the primary care setting and has the potential to be used alongside a non-invasive biomarker test to increase earlier diagnosis. This would result in a greater number of patients surviving this devastating disease.","Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; *Algorithms; Case-Control Studies; Early Detection of Cancer/*methods; Electronic Health Records/*statistics & numerical data; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; *Machine Learning; Male; Middle Aged; Pancreatic Neoplasms/*diagnosis; Primary Health Care/*statistics & numerical data; Prognosis; Prospective Studies; Risk Assessment/*methods; Survival Rate; Young Adult",Malhotra A; Rachet B; Bonaventure A; Pereira SP; Woods LM,PloS one,2021,,PLoS One. 2021 Jun 2;16(6):e0251876. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0251876. eCollection 2021.,United States,421,8171946
34026608,Plasma-Derived Exosomal ALIX as a Novel Biomarker for Diagnosis and Classification of Pancreatic Cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Pancreatic cancer (PC) has a dismal prognosis due to its insidious early symptoms and poor early detection rate. Exosomes can be released by various cell types and tend to be a potential novel biomarker for PC detection. In this study, we explored the proteomic profiles of plasma exosomes collected from patients with PC at different stages and other pancreatic diseases. METHODS: Plasma samples were collected from six groups of patients, including PC at stage I/II, PC at stage III/IV, well-differentiated pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (P-NET), pancreatic cystic lesions (PCLs), chronic pancreatitis (CP), and healthy controls (HCs). Plasma-derived exosomes were isolated by ultracentrifugation and identified routinely. Isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) based proteomic analysis along with bioinformatic analysis were performed to elucidate the biological functions of proteins. The expression of exosomal ALIX was further confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in a larger cohort of patients. Furthermore, receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was applied to evaluate the potential of ALIX as a novel diagnostic biomarker. RESULTS: The proteomic profile revealed a total of 623 proteins expressed among the six groups, and 16 proteins with differential degrees of abundance were found in PC vs. other pancreatic diseases (including P-NET, PCLs, and CP). Based on the results of proteomic and bioinformatic analyses, exosomal ALIX was subsequently selected as a novel biomarker for PC detection and validated in another clinical cohort. We noticed that ALIX expression was elevated in PC patients compared with patients with other pancreatic diseases or HC, and it was also closely associated with TNM stage and distant metastasis. Interestingly, the combination of exosomal ALIX and serum CA199 has greater values in differentiating both early vs. late PC (AUC value 0.872) and PC vs. other pancreatic diseases (AUC value 0.910) than either ALIX or CA199 alone. CONCLUSION: In summary, our study demonstrated that based on proteomic profiling, proteins isolated from the plasma-derived exosomes may function as ideal non-invasive biomarkers for the clinical diagnosis of PC. Importantly, exosomal ALIX combined with CA199 has great potentials in detection of PC, especially in distinguishing PC patients at early stages from advanced stages.",,Yang J; Zhang Y; Gao X; Yuan Y; Zhao J; Zhou S; Wang H; Wang L; Xu G; Li X; Wang P; Zou X; Zhu D; Lv Y; Zhang S,Frontiers in oncology,2021,,Front Oncol. 2021 May 5;11:628346. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2021.628346. eCollection 2021.,Switzerland,470,8131866

Indeed, primary tumor progression could be associated with severe symptoms, compromising the quality of life and the feasibility of effective systemic therapy, and might result in life-threatening complications.

40075651,Diagnostic Accuracy of Radiomics in the Early Detection of Pancreatic Cancer: A Systematic Review and Qualitative Assessment Using the Methodological Radiomics Score (METRICS).,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an aggressive and lethal malignancy with increasing incidence and low survival rate, primarily due to the late detection of the disease. Radiomics has demonstrated its utility in recognizing patterns and anomalies not perceptible to the human eye. This systematic literature review aims to assess the application of radiomics in the analysis of pancreatic parenchyma images to identify early indicators predictive of PDAC. METHODS: A systematic search of original research papers was performed on three databases: PubMed, Embase, and Scopus. Two reviewers applied the inclusion and exclusion criteria, and one expert solved conflicts for selecting the articles. After extraction and analysis of the data, there was a quality assessment of these articles using the Methodological Radiomics Score (METRICS) tool. The METRICS assessment was carried out by two raters, and conflicts were solved by a third reviewer. RESULTS: Ten articles for analysis were retrieved. CT scan was the diagnostic imaging used in all the articles. All the studies were retrospective and published between 2019 and 2024. The main objective of the articles was to generate radiomics-based machine learning models able to differentiate pancreatic tumors from healthy tissue. The reported diagnostic performance of the model chosen yielded very high results, with a diagnostic accuracy between 86.5% and 99.2%. Texture and shape features were the most frequently implemented. The METRICS scoring assessment demonstrated that three articles obtained a moderate quality, five a good quality, and, finally, two articles yielded excellent quality. The lack of external validation and available model, code, and data were the major limitations according to the qualitative assessment. CONCLUSIONS: There is high heterogeneity in the research question regarding radiomics and pancreatic cancer. The principal limitations of the studies were mainly due to the nature of the trials and the considerable heterogeneity of the radiomic features reported. Nonetheless, the work in this field is promising, and further studies are still required to adopt radiomics in the early detection of PDAC.",,Renjifo-Correa ME; Fanni SC; Bustamante-Cristancho LA; Cuibari ME; Aghakhanyan G; Faggioni L; Neri E; Cioni D,Cancers,2025,Feb,Cancers (Basel). 2025 Feb 26;17(5):803. doi: 10.3390/cancers17050803.,Switzerland,722,11898638
28086830,"Sigma-2 receptor agonist derivatives of 1-Cyclohexyl-4-[3-(5-methoxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalen-1-yl)propyl]piperazine (PB28) induce cell death via mitochondrial superoxide production and caspase activation in pancreatic cancer.","BACKGROUND: Despite considerable efforts by scientific research, pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer related mortalities. Sigma-2 receptors, which are overexpressed in several tumors, represent promising targets for triggering selective pancreatic cancer cells death. METHODS: We selected five differently structured high-affinity sigma-2 ligands (PB28, PB183, PB221, F281 and PB282) to study how they affect the viability of diverse pancreatic cancer cells (human cell lines BxPC3, AsPC1, Mia PaCa-2, and Panc1 and mouse Panc-02, KCKO and KP-02) and how this is reflected in vivo in a tumor model. RESULTS: Important cytotoxicity was shown by the compounds in the aggressive Panc02 cells, where cytotoxic activity was caspase-3 independent for four of the five compounds. However, both cytotoxicity and caspase-3 activation involved generation of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), which could be partially reverted by the lipid antioxidant alpha-tocopherol, but not by the hydrophilic N-acetylcysteine (NAC) indicating crucial differences in the intracellular sites exposed to oxidative stress induced by sigma-2 receptor ligands. Importantly, all the compounds strongly increased the production of mitochondrial superoxide radicals except for PB282. Despite a poor match between in vitro and the in vivo efficacy, daily treatment of C57BL/6 mice bearing Panc02 tumors resulted in promising effects with PB28 and PB282 which were similar compared to the current standard-of-care chemotherapeutic gemcitabine without showing signs of systemic toxicities. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, this study identified differential sensitivities of pancreatic cancer cells to structurally diverse sigma-2 receptor ligands. Of note, we identified the mitochondrial superoxide pathway as a previously unrecognized sigma-2 receptor-activated process, which encourages further studies on sigma-2 ligand-mediated cancer cell death for the targeted treatment of pancreatic tumors.","Animals; Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology; Apoptosis/drug effects; Caspase 3/*metabolism; Cell Death/*drug effects; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation/drug effects; Female; Humans; Ligands; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mitochondria/*drug effects/metabolism; Pancreatic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism; Piperazine; Piperazines/*pharmacology; Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism; Receptors, sigma/*agonists; Superoxides/*metabolism",Pati ML; Hornick JR; Niso M; Berardi F; Spitzer D; Abate C; Hawkins W,BMC cancer,2017,Jan,BMC Cancer. 2017 Jan 13;17(1):51. doi: 10.1186/s12885-016-3040-4.,England,344,5237291
35197099,Sensitive and selective detection of Mucin1 in pancreatic cancer using hybridization chain reaction with the assistance of Fe(3)O(4)@polydopamine nanocomposites.,"Pancreatic cancer is characterized as the worst for diagnosis lacking symptoms at the early stage, which results in a low overall survival rate. The frequently used techniques for pancreatic cancer diagnosis rely on imaging and biopsy, which have limitations in requiring experienced personnel to operate the expensive instruments and analyze the results. Therefore, there is a high demand to develop alternative tools or methods to detect pancreatic cancer. Herein, we propose a new strategy to enhance the detection sensitivity of pancreatic cancer cells both in biofluids and on tissues by combining the unique property of dopamine coated Fe(3)O(4) nanoparticles (Fe(3)O(4)@DOP NPs) to specifically quench and separate free 6-carboxyfluorescein (FAM) labeled DNA (H(1)-FAM/H(2)-FAM), and the key feature of hybridization chain reaction (HCR) amplification. We have determined the limit of detection (LOD) to be 21 ~ 41 cells/mL for three different pancreatic cancer cell lines. It was also discovered that the fluorescence intensity of pancreatic cancer cells was significantly higher than that of HPDE-C7 and HepG-2 cells (control cell lines), which express lower MUC1 protein. Moreover, the HCR amplification system was used to identify the cancer cells on pancreatic tissue, which indicated the versatility of our strategy in clinical application. Therefore, the presented detection strategy shows good sensitivity, specificity and has great potential for the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer.",*Biosensing Techniques/methods; Humans; Indoles; Limit of Detection; *Nanocomposites; Nucleic Acid Hybridization; *Pancreatic Neoplasms/diagnosis; Polymers,Dong Q; Jia X; Wang Y; Wang H; Liu Q; Li D; Wang J; Wang E,Journal of nanobiotechnology,2022,Feb,J Nanobiotechnology. 2022 Feb 23;20(1):94. doi: 10.1186/s12951-022-01289-w.,England,361,8867748
39995556,Pancreatic cancer: Future challenges and new perspectives for an early diagnosis.,"This editorial is a commentary on the case report by Furuya et al focusing on the challenging diagnosis of early pancreatic adenocarcinoma and new tools for an earlier diagnosis. Currently, pancreatic cancer still has a poor prognosis, mainly due to late diagnosis in an advanced stage. Two main precancerous routes have been identified as pathways to pancreatic adenocarcinoma: The first encompasses a large group of mucinous cystic lesions: intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm and mucinous cystic neoplasm, and the second is pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia. In the last decade the focus of research has been to identify high-risk patients, using advanced imaging techniques (magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography or endoscopic ultrasonography) which could be helpful in finding ""indirect signs"" of early stage pancreatic lesions. Nevertheless, the survival rate still remains poor, and alternative screening methods are under investigation. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography followed by serial pancreatic juice aspiration cytology could be a promising tool for identifying precursor lesions such as intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm, but confirming data are still needed to validate its role. Probably a combination of cross-sectional imaging, endoscopic techniques (old and new ones) and genetic and biological biomarkers (also in pancreatic juice) could be the best solution to reach an early diagnosis. Biomarkers could help to predict and follow the progression of early pancreatic lesions. However, further studies are needed to validate their diagnostic reliability and to establish diagnostic algorithms to improve prognosis and survival in patients with pancreatic cancer.",,Cocca S; Pontillo G; Lupo M; Lieto R; Marocchi M; Marsico M; Dell'Aquila E; Mangiafico S; Grande G; Conigliaro R; Bertani H,World journal of clinical oncology,2025,Feb,World J Clin Oncol. 2025 Feb 24;16(2):97248. doi: 10.5306/wjco.v16.i2.97248.,United States,475,11686566
26911459,Successful resolution of a hemorrhagic pancreatic pseudocyst ruptured into the stomach complicating obstructive pancreatitis due to pancreatic cancer: a case report.,"BACKGROUND: Hematemesis is uncommon as an initial presenting symptom in pancreatic cancer. We present herein a case of a pseudoaneurysm that ruptured and fistulized into the stomach. The pseudoaneurysm was secondary to a pancreatic pseudocyst complicating obstructive pancreatitis due to pancreatic cancer. The patient was successfully treated using trans-arterial embolization followed by curative surgery. CASE PRESENTATION: A 61-year-old man presented to the emergency room with hematemesis. Laboratory examinations revealed a low level of hemoglobin (5.0 g/dl). The patient had presented to another hospital due to hematemesis 1 month before presenting to our hospital. A low-density mass in the pancreatic body with dilatation of the distal main pancreatic duct and a pseudocyst in the pancreatic tail had been observed by radiology at the previous hospital. Further investigation had been planned. Abdominal computed tomography on admission to our hospital demonstrated a pseudoaneurysm in close contact with the wall of the pseudocyst of the pancreatic tail, compressing the stomach. The pseudoaneurysm had not been detected by abdominal computed tomography at the previous hospital. Emergency selective angiography revealed that the pseudoaneurysm arose from the left gastroepiploic artery branching from the splenic artery. Trans-arterial embolization of the left gastroepiploic artery through the splenic artery was successfully performed. Elective distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy with regional lymph node dissection combined with partial resection of the stomach was performed 3 weeks after coil embolization. Pathological examination revealed a moderately differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma in the pancreatic body with regional lymph node metastasis and revealed the pseudoaneurysm rupturing into the pancreatic pseudocyst. The patient has experienced no tumor recurrence or metastasis during 1 year of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Spontaneous rupture of a pseudoaneurysm is a rare and potentially lethal complication of a pancreatic pseudocyst. Most affected patients have a history of alcoholism and suffer from acute or chronic pancreatitis. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of a hemorrhagic pancreatic pseudocyst complicating obstructive pancreatitis due to pancreatic cancer.","Aged; *Aneurysm, False; *Embolization, Therapeutic; *Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage; Humans; Male; Pancreatectomy; Pancreatic Neoplasms/*physiopathology; Pancreatic Pseudocyst/*complications; Pancreatitis, Chronic/*complications; Prognosis; Rupture, Spontaneous/complications; Stomach Diseases/etiology/*therapy",Hoshimoto S; Aiura K; Shito M; Kakefuda T; Sugiura H,World journal of surgical oncology,2016,Feb,World J Surg Oncol. 2016 Feb 24;14(1):46. doi: 10.1186/s12957-016-0812-x.,England,460,4765158
28144398,Epithelial-mesenchymal transition as a therapeutic target for overcoming chemoresistance in pancreatic cancer.,"Pancreatic cancer has one of the worst prognoses among all cancers due to the late manifestation of identifiable symptoms and high resistance to chemo- and radiation therapies. In recent years, a cancer development phase termed epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) has gained increasing research focus. The process is implicated in tumour metastasis, and emerging evidence suggests EMT also contributes or induces chemoresistance in several cancers. Nevertheless, the applicability of therapeutic targeting of EMT faces many challenges. In this mini-review, we summarise the evidence supporting the role of EMT in pancreatic cancer progression, focusing particularly on its association with chemoresistance.",,Elaskalani O; Razak NB; Falasca M; Metharom P,World journal of gastrointestinal oncology,2017,Jan,World J Gastrointest Oncol. 2017 Jan 15;9(1):37-41. doi: 10.4251/wjgo.v9.i1.37.,China,506,5241525
33357065,"Pancreatic Cancer: A Review of Risk Factors, Diagnosis, and Treatment.","This review aims to summarize the latest knowledge on factors, diagnosis, and treatment of pancreatic cancer, and aims to promote further research on this under-studied malignant tumor. At present, we urgently need to identify high-risk patients with precancerous diseases through screening approaches, so that medical professionals and the general public may better understand prevention strategies or early detection measures. Pancreatic cancer is a highly invasive malignant tumor with a fatal risk, mainly seen in men and older adults (60-85 years old). Pancreatic cancer is now increasingly observed in young patients. Because the disease has no early symptoms and can quickly invade surrounding tissues and organs, it is one of the deadliest cancers. With a view to identify the important factors for the development of pancreatic cancer, previous studies have found that smoking, alcohol, and chronic pancreatitis are considered high-risk factors. Recent studies have shown that abnormal metabolism of human microorganisms, blood type, and glucose and lipid levels are also important factors in the development of pancreatic cancer. Identifying early diagnosis options is an important way to improve detection and survival rates of pancreatic cancer. None of the many tumor markers associated with pancreatic cancer are highly specific, which also indicates further research is required to improve the early detection rate. Future directions in terms of treatment evaluating the relationship between the microbiology-free system and immunotherapy will bring a major breakthrough and is expected to bring exciting clinical applications in improving the life-cycle of pancreatic cancer patients.","Animals; Biomarkers, Tumor; Combined Modality Therapy/methods; Diagnostic Imaging; Disease Management; Disease Susceptibility; Endoscopy/methods; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Humans; Pancreatic Neoplasms/*diagnosis/*etiology/mortality/*therapy; Pathology, Molecular; Prognosis; Risk Factors; Treatment Outcome",Zhao Z; Liu W,Technology in cancer research & treatment,2020,Jan-Dec,Technol Cancer Res Treat. 2020 Jan-Dec;19:1533033820962117. doi: 10.1177/1533033820962117.,United States,643,7768873
30834048,"Epidemiology of Pancreatic Cancer: Global Trends, Etiology and Risk Factors.","Pancreatic cancer is the seventh leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. However, its toll is higher in more developed countries. Reasons for vast differences in mortality rates of pancreatic cancer are not completely clear yet, but it may be due to lack of appropriate diagnosis, treatment and cataloging of cancer cases. Because patients seldom exhibit symptoms until an advanced stage of the disease, pancreatic cancer remains one of the most lethal malignant neoplasms that caused 432,242 new deaths in 2018 (GLOBOCAN 2018 estimates). Globally, 458,918 new cases of pancreatic cancer have been reported in 2018, and 355,317 new cases are estimated to occur until 2040. Despite advancements in the detection and management of pancreatic cancer, the 5-year survival rate still stands at 9% only. To date, the causes of pancreatic carcinoma are still insufficiently known, although certain risk factors have been identified, such as tobacco smoking, diabetes mellitus, obesity, dietary factors, alcohol abuse, age, ethnicity, family history and genetic factors, Helicobacter pylori infection, non-O blood group and chronic pancreatitis. In general population, screening of large groups is not considered useful to detect the disease at its early stage, although newer techniques and the screening of tightly targeted groups (especially of those with family history), are being evaluated. Primary prevention is considered of utmost importance. Up-to-date statistics on pancreatic cancer occurrence and outcome along with a better understanding of the etiology and identifying the causative risk factors are essential for the primary prevention of this disease.",,Rawla P; Sunkara T; Gaduputi V,World journal of oncology,2019,Feb,World J Oncol. 2019 Feb;10(1):10-27. doi: 10.14740/wjon1166.

33360334,"Splenic artery transposition for hepatic arterial reconstruction in conversion surgery of an initially unresectable, locally advanced pancreatic cancer after gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel: A case report.","INTRODUCTION AND IMPORTANCE: Recent advances in chemotherapy and chemoradiotherapy allow performance of conversion surgery by improving tumor shrinkage in select patients with initially unresectable locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC), thereby providing curative potential. The number of conversion surgeries requiring arterial reconstruction for select patients with initially unresectable LAPC following favorable responses is expected to increase, so providing effective options for safe arterial reconstruction is critical. CASE PRESENTATION: Herein we report a case of successful conversion surgery for initially unresectable LAPC with splenic artery transposition for hepatic arterial reconstruction after gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel (GnP). A 71-year-old woman was referred to our hospital for evaluation of a pancreatic head mass after developing diabetes. She was diagnosed with unresectable LAPC, which was in wide contact with the common hepatic artery (CHA), proper hepatic artery (PHA), and splenic artery (SA). She received GnP, and after 6 cycles, durations of disease control and normalization of serum carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) exceeded 7 months. She underwent radical subtotal stomach-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy with CHA-PHA and portal vein (PV) resection (SA-right hepatic artery anastomosis/PV-superior mesenteric vein direct end-to-end anastomosis). Histopathological examination revealed R0 resection with a histological response of Evans grade IIB. No signs of tumor recurrence have been observed for 14 months postoperatively. CLINICAL DISCUSSION: No consensus has been reached regarding the optimal treatment regimen, duration, or criteria for conversion surgery in patients with LAPC, especially in cases requiring arterial resection. SA transposition for hepatic arterial reconstruction is generally very consistent, easily accessible, and offers adequate length and diameter for successful arterial anastomosis. CONCLUSION: Even for a SA initially in contact with the tumor, SA transposition for hepatic artery reconstruction is a safe and effective option when tumor contact disappears due to chemotherapy.",,Tanaka H; Imai H; Higashi T; Murase K; Matsuhashi N; Yoshida K,International journal of surgery case reports,2021,Jan,Int J Surg Case Rep. 2021 Jan;78:192-196. doi: 10.1016/j.ijscr.2020.12.041.

40471466,Pancreatic Cancer Risk Assessment Tools in Primary Care: A Mixed Methods Systematic Review.,"BACKGROUND: Pancreatic cancer is the twelfth most common cancer worldwide, but high mortality rates make it the sixth leading cause of cancer deaths. Diagnosis is frequently too late for curative intervention. Risk assessment tools incorporating diagnostic prediction models may assist early pancreatic cancer detection by primary care clinicians. AIM AND METHODS: This mixed methods systematic review aims to identify risk assessment tools which can be used for the detection of pancreatic cancer and have been investigated in primary care. It also seeks to synthesise the qualitative and quantitative evidence relating to the patient and clinician perspectives and experiences with these tools. RESULTS: Ten studies were included with five risk assessment tools identified: 'QCancer', 'eRATs' (electronic risk assessment tools), 'CaDet', 'Future Health Today' and 'C the Signs'. No tools were found for pancreatic cancer alone. Thematic synthesis of stakeholder perspectives resulted in three themes: impact on clinical decision-making, impact on patient consultations and implementation barriers and facilitators. Overall, experiences and impacts were positive, especially if used by less experienced clinicians. CONCLUSION: There is little evidence for the inclusion of many developed pancreatic cancer diagnostic prediction models in risk assessment tools in primary care, and limited research into stakeholder perceptions, especially patient perceptions. This review can inform future tool development, and further research should be undertaken assessing these tools' clinical validity to encourage uptake in clinical practice.

17194196,Palladin mutation causes familial pancreatic cancer and suggests a new cancer mechanism.,"BACKGROUND: Pancreatic cancer is a deadly disease. Discovery of the mutated genes that cause the inherited form(s) of the disease may shed light on the mechanism(s) of oncogenesis. Previously we isolated a susceptibility locus for familial pancreatic cancer to chromosome location 4q32-34. In this study, our goal was to discover the identity of the familial pancreatic cancer gene on 4q32 and determine the function of that gene. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A customized microarray of the candidate chromosomal region affecting pancreatic cancer susceptibility revealed the greatest expression change in palladin (PALLD), a gene that encodes a component of the cytoskeleton that controls cell shape and motility. A mutation causing a proline (hydrophobic) to serine (hydrophilic) amino acid change (P239S) in a highly conserved region tracked with all affected family members and was absent in the non-affected members. The mutational change is not a known single nucleotide polymorphism. Palladin RNA, measured by quantitative RT-PCR, was overexpressed in the tissues from precancerous dysplasia and pancreatic adenocarcinoma in both familial and sporadic disease. Transfection of wild-type and P239S mutant palladin gene constructs into HeLa cells revealed a clear phenotypic effect: cells expressing P239S palladin exhibited cytoskeletal changes, abnormal actin bundle assembly, and an increased ability to migrate. CONCLUSIONS: These observations suggest that the presence of an abnormal palladin gene in familial pancreatic cancer and the overexpression of palladin protein in sporadic pancreatic cancer cause cytoskeletal changes in pancreatic cancer and may be responsible for or contribute to the tumor's strong invasive and migratory abilities.","Actinin/genetics; Adenocarcinoma/*genetics; Blotting, Western; Carcinoma in Situ/genetics; Cell Movement; Chromosomes, Human, Pair 4/*genetics; Cytoskeletal Proteins/*genetics; Cytoskeleton/physiology; Disease Progression; Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Genetic Predisposition to Disease/*genetics; HeLa Cells; Humans; *Mutation; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Pancreatic Neoplasms/*genetics; Pedigree; Phosphoproteins/*genetics; Precancerous Conditions/genetics; Proto-Oncogenes/genetics; Transfection",Pogue-Geile KL; Chen R; Bronner MP; Crnogorac-Jurcevic T; Moyes KW; Dowen S; Otey CA; Crispin DA; George RD; Whitcomb DC; Brentnall TA,PLoS medicine,2006,Dec,PLoS Med. 2006 Dec;3(12):e516. doi: 10.1371/journal.pmed.0030516.,United States,1059,1751121
39208354,Identification of a serum proteomic biomarker panel using diagnosis specific ensemble learning and symptoms for early pancreatic cancer detection.,"BACKGROUND: The grim (<10% 5-year) survival rates for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) are attributed to its complex intrinsic biology and most often late-stage detection. The overlap of symptoms with benign gastrointestinal conditions in early stage further complicates timely detection. The suboptimal diagnostic performance of carbohydrate antigen (CA) 19-9 and elevation in benign hyperbilirubinaemia undermine its reliability, leaving a notable absence of accurate diagnostic biomarkers. Using a selected patient cohort with benign pancreatic and biliary tract conditions we aimed to develop a data analysis protocol leading to a biomarker signature capable of distinguishing patients with non-specific yet concerning clinical presentations, from those with PDAC. METHODS: 539 patient serum samples collected under the Accelerated Diagnosis of neuro Endocrine and Pancreatic TumourS (ADEPTS) study (benign disease controls and PDACs) and the UK Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening (UKCTOCS, healthy controls) were screened using the Olink Oncology II panel, supplemented with five in-house markers. 16 specialized base-learner classifiers were stacked to select and enhance biomarker performances and robustness in blinded samples. Each base-learner was constructed through cross-validation and recursive feature elimination in a discovery set comprising approximately two thirds of the ADEPTS and UKCTOCS samples and contrasted specific diagnosis with PDAC. RESULTS: The signature which was developed using diagnosis-specific ensemble learning demonstrated predictive capabilities outperforming CA19-9, the only biomarker currently accepted by the FDA and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines for pancreatic cancer, and other individual biomarkers and combinations in both discovery and held-out validation sets. An AUC of 0.98 (95% CI 0.98-0.99) and sensitivity of 0.99 (95% CI 0.98-1) at 90% specificity was achieved with the ensemble method, which was significantly larger than the AUC of 0.79 (95% CI 0.66-0.91) and sensitivity 0.67 (95% CI 0.50-0.83), also at 90% specificity, for CA19-9, in the discovery set (p = 0.0016 and p = 0.00050, respectively). During ensemble signature validation in the held-out set, an AUC of 0.95 (95% CI 0.91-0.99), sensitivity 0.86 (95% CI 0.68-1), was attained compared to an AUC of 0.80 (95% CI 0.66-0.93), sensitivity 0.65 (95% CI 0.48-0.56) at 90% specificity for CA19-9 alone (p = 0.0082 and p = 0.024, respectively). When validated only on the benign disease controls and PDACs collected from ADEPTS, the diagnostic-specific signature achieved an AUC of 0.96 (95% CI 0.92-0.99), sensitivity 0.82 (95% CI 0.64-0.95) at 90% specificity, which was still significantly higher than the performance for CA19-9 taken as a single predictor, AUC of 0.79 (95% CI 0.64-0.93) and sensitivity of 0.18 (95% CI 0.03-0.69) (p = 0.013 and p = 0.0055, respectively). CONCLUSION: Our ensemble modelling technique outperformed CA19-9, individual biomarkers and indices developed with prevailing algorithms in distinguishing patients with non-specific but concerning symptoms from those with PDAC, with implications for improving its early detection in individuals at risk.","Humans; *Pancreatic Neoplasms/blood/diagnosis; *Biomarkers, Tumor/blood; *Early Detection of Cancer/methods; Female; Middle Aged; *Proteomics/methods; Male; Aged; Carcinoma, Pancreatic Ductal/blood/diagnosis; Machine Learning; Computational Biology/methods",Ney A; Nene NR; Sedlak E; Acedo P; Blyuss O; Whitwell HJ; Costello E; Gentry-Maharaj A; Williams NR; Menon U; Fusai GK; Zaikin A; Pereira SP,PLoS computational biology,2024,Aug,PLoS Comput Biol. 2024 Aug 29;20(8):e1012408. doi: 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012408. eCollection 2024 Aug.,United States,656,11389906
36077794,Pancreatic Cancer: Challenges and Opportunities in Locoregional Therapies.,"Pancreatic cancer (PC) remains the seventh leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide and the third in the United States, making it one of the most lethal solid malignancies. Unfortunately, the symptoms of this disease are not very apparent despite an increasing incidence rate. Therefore, at the time of diagnosis, 45% of patients have already developed metastatic tumours. Due to the aggressive nature of the pancreatic tumours, local interventions are required in addition to first-line treatments. Locoregional interventions affect a specific area of the pancreas to minimize local tumour recurrence and reduce the side effects on surrounding healthy tissues. However, compared to the number of new studies on systemic therapy, very little research has been conducted on localised interventions for PC. To address this unbalanced focus and to shed light on the tremendous potentials of locoregional therapies, this work will provide a detailed discussion of various localised treatment strategies. Most importantly, to the best of our knowledge, the aspect of localised drug delivery systems used in PC was unprecedentedly discussed in this work. This review is meant for researchers and clinicians considering utilizing local therapy for the effective treatment of PC, providing a thorough guide on recent advancements in research and clinical trials toward locoregional interventions, together with the authors' insight into their potential improvements.",,Bazeed AY; Day CM; Garg S,Cancers,2022,Aug,Cancers (Basel). 2022 Aug 31;14(17):4257. doi: 10.3390/cancers14174257.,Switzerland,469,9454856
36544073,"Systematic review of caregiver burden, unmet needs and quality-of-life among informal caregivers of patients with pancreatic cancer.","PURPOSE: Informal caregivers play an important supportive care role for patients with cancer. This may be especially true for pancreatic cancer which is often diagnosed late, has a poor prognosis and is associated with a significant symptom burden. We systematically reviewed the evidence on caregiver burden, unmet needs and quality-of-life of informal caregivers to patients with pancreatic cancer. METHOD: PubMed, Medline, CINAHL and Embase databases were systematically searched on 31 August 2021. Qualitative and quantitative data on informal caregivers' experiences were extracted and coded into themes of burden, unmet needs or quality-of-life with narrative synthesis of the data undertaken. RESULTS: Nine studies (five qualitative, four quantitative), including 6023 informal caregivers, were included in the review. We categorised data into three key themes: caregiver burden, unmet needs and quality-of-life. Data on caregiver burden was organised into a single subtheme relating to symptom management as a source of burden. Data on unmet needs was organised into three subthemes need for: better clinical communication; support and briefings for caregivers; and help with navigating the health care system. Data on quality-of-life indicate large proportions of informal caregivers experience clinical levels of anxiety (33%) or depression (12%-32%). All five qualitative studies were graded as good quality; three quantitative studies were poor quality, and one was fair quality. CONCLUSION: High-quality pancreatic cancer care should consider the impacts of informal caregiving.

20422030,Preoperative/neoadjuvant therapy in pancreatic cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis of response and resection percentages.,"BACKGROUND: Pancreatic cancer has an extremely poor prognosis and prolonged survival is achieved only by resection with macroscopic tumor clearance. There is a strong rationale for a neoadjuvant approach, since a relevant percentage of pancreatic cancer patients present with non-metastatic but locally advanced disease and microscopic incomplete resections are common. The objective of the present analysis was to systematically review studies concerning the effects of neoadjuvant therapy on tumor response, toxicity, resection, and survival percentages in pancreatic cancer. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Trials were identified by searching MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from 1966 to December 2009 as well as through reference lists of articles and proceedings of major meetings. Retrospective and prospective studies analyzing neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy, radiotherapy, or chemotherapy of pancreatic cancer patients, followed by re-staging, and surgical exploration/resection were included. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed study quality. Pooled relative risks and 95% confidence intervals were calculated using random-effects models. Primary outcome measures were proportions of tumor response categories and percentages of exploration and resection. A total of 111 studies (n = 4,394) including 56 phase I-II trials were analyzed. A median of 31 (interquartile range [IQR] 19-46) patients per study were included. Studies were subdivided into surveys considering initially resectable tumors (group 1) and initially non-resectable (borderline resectable/unresectable) tumors (group 2). Neoadjuvant chemotherapy was given in 96.4% of the studies with the main agents gemcitabine, 5-FU (and oral analogues), mitomycin C, and platinum compounds. Neoadjuvant radiotherapy was applied in 93.7% of the studies with doses ranging from 24 to 63 Gy. Averaged complete/partial response probabilities were 3.6% (95% CI 2%-5.5%)/30.6% (95% CI 20.7%-41.4%) and 4.8% (95% CI 3.5%-6.4%)/30.2% (95% CI 24.5%-36.3%) for groups 1 and 2, respectively; whereas progressive disease fraction was estimated to 20.9% (95% CI 16.9%-25.3%) and 20.8% (95% CI 14.5%-27.8%). In group 1, resectability was estimated to 73.6% (95% CI 65.9%-80.6%) compared to 33.2% (95% CI 25.8%-41.1%) in group 2. Higher resection-associated morbidity and mortality rates were observed in group 2 versus group 1 (26.7%, 95% CI 20.7%-33.3% versus 39.1%, 95% CI 29.5%-49.1%; and 3.9%, 95% CI 2.2%-6% versus 7.1%, 95% CI 5.1%-9.5%). Combination chemotherapies resulted in higher estimated response and resection probabilities for patients with initially non-resectable tumors (""non-resectable tumor patients"") compared to monotherapy. Estimated median survival following resection was 23.3 (range 12-54) mo for group 1 and 20.5 (range 9-62) mo for group 2 patients. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with initially resectable tumors (""resectable tumor patients""), resection frequencies and survival after neoadjuvant therapy are similar to those of patients with primarily resected tumors and adjuvant therapy. Approximately one-third of initially staged non-resectable tumor patients would be expected to have resectable tumors following neoadjuvant therapy, with comparable survival as initially resectable tumor patients. Thus, patients with locally non-resectable tumors should be included in neoadjuvant protocols and subsequently re-evaluated for resection.",Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use; Humans; Neoadjuvant Therapy/*methods; Pancreatic Neoplasms/surgery/*therapy; Preoperative Care; Treatment Outcome,Gillen S; Schuster T; Meyer Zum Buschenfelde C; Friess H; Kleeff J,PLoS medicine,2010,Apr,PLoS Med. 2010 Apr 20;7(4):e1000267. doi: 10.1371/journal.pmed.1000267.,United States,1599,2857873

38473242,A 15-Year Single-Institution Retrospective Study of Primary Pancreatic Cancer Treated with Non-Ablative Palliative Radiotherapy.,"We studied the use of palliative radiotherapy (RT) among patients with primary, non-curable, locally advanced pancreatic cancer. In this subset of patients, with very poor survival, various palliative RT dose fractionation schemes are used; but, in the absence of a guideline, practice patterns vary, and dose choice is mainly based on the physician's intuition. We divided the patients into three groups, according to the dose fractionation schedules received: low (A), intermediate (B), and high (C) dose groups, to study the potential differences in outcome between the different dose prescriptions. Cohort: n = 184. Median age: 69 years. Male: n = 105 (57%), female: n = 79 (43%). Stage IV: n = 117 (64%). T4: n = 127 (69%). Tumor location: head: n = 109 (59%), body: n = 37 (20%), tail: n = 25 (14%), neck: n = 11 (6%), and uncinate: n = 2 (1%). Prior systemic therapy: n = 66 (36%). Most common dose fractionations received: 20 Gy in five fractions n = 67 (36%), 30 Gy in 10 fractions n = 49 (27%), and 8 Gy in one fraction n = 23 (13%). Group A: n = 33 (18%), median overall survival (OS) 19 days (95% CI 4-33). Group B: n = 84 (46%), median OS 52 days (95% CI 43-60). Group C: n = 67 (36%), median OS 126 days (95% CI 77-174). Median days to in-field progression: Group A 59 days (range 7-109), Group B 96 days (range 19-173), and Group C 97 days (range 13-475). To our knowledge, this is the largest reported retrospective cohort of patients receiving non-ablative palliative RT to treat their primary pancreatic tumors. Most patients had metastatic disease, T4 tumors of the pancreatic head and had not received prior systemic therapy. A significant survival benefit was seen favoring the high dose/longer RT fractionation group, presumably due to appropriate patient selection rather than an RT effect. Despite the relatively short median overall survival, one fifth of the patients were found to experience an in-field progression following RT.",,Kamel R; Zhang T; Comino S; Dennis K,Cancers,2024,Feb,Cancers (Basel). 2024 Feb 22;16(5):881. doi: 10.3390/cancers16050881.,Switzerland,537,10930540
28599648,Surgeons' knowledge regarding the diagnosis and management of pancreatic cancer in China: a cross-sectional study.,"BACKGROUND: Pancreatic cancer is rare but highly malignant. Studies have shown that surgeons' knowledge closely links to the correct diagnosis and treatment outcomes of pancreatic cancer. The purpose of this study was to survey current surgeons' knowledge regarding pancreatic cancer. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 705 surgeons who attended the 2011 China Surgical Week's meeting in Beijing. A questionnaire regarding the risk factors, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of pancreatic cancer was used. Surgeons' answers were analyzed and compared among different regions, levels of hospital, and professional ranks. RESULTS: Most surgeons had a correct knowledge toward the risk factors, diagnosis, and management of pancreatic cancer. However, several knowledge gaps were identified. They include ""The association between type 2 diabetes and pancreatic cancer"", ""The most common histologic type of pancreatic neoplasm"", ""the typical clinical symptoms of pancreatic cancer"", ""The accuracy of ultrasound in screening pancreatic cancer"", ""Enhanced CT in the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer"", and ""Which is more superior between MRI and CT in the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer"". We also found that overall surgeons' responses did not depend on their geographic locations, but on hospital levels and professional ranks. Surgeons working at level three hospitals had better knowledge than others in certain areas and resident surgeons had fewer correct answers in some areas. CONCLUSIONS: Although most surgeons have a good knowledge in most areas related to the diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic cancer in China, certain knowledge gaps exist, particularly among trainees and those from low level hospitals. Continuing medical education programs to improve these knowledge gaps should be implemented.","China; Clinical Competence/*statistics & numerical data; Cross-Sectional Studies; Hospitals; Humans; Internship and Residency; Medical Staff, Hospital; *Pancreatic Neoplasms/diagnosis/etiology/therapy; Risk Factors; *Surgeons; Surveys and Questionnaires",Li BQ; Wang L; Li J; Zhou L; Zhang TP; Guo JC; Zhao YP,BMC health services research,2017,Jun,BMC Health Serv Res. 2017 Jun 9;17(1):395. doi: 10.1186/s12913-017-2345-6.,England,373,5466735
37942046,Unusual paraneoplastic syndromes in pancreatic cancer: a case report of Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) associated with intraductal papillary mucinous cancer of the pancreas.,"BACKGROUND: Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) is an autoimmune disorder of the neuromuscular junction. It can occur as a paraneoplastic disorder associated with various types of carcinomas, usually small cell lung cancer or as an autoimmune disease. LEMS can be misdiagnosed as myasthenia gravis or as an oncological sequela, causing delays in diagnosis. We present a rare case of a male adult with confirmed LEMS occurring with pancreatic carcinoma. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 66-year-old man presented with a newly diagnosed pancreatic tumor. He had been experiencing weakness and fatigue in his lower extremities since the summer of 2020. Over time, the weakness progressed to include his proximal upper extremity muscles. Dysphonia, dysarthria, decreased appetite and significant weight loss were also observed. A computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a 3 cm locally resectable cystic tumor in the pancreatic head. Blood tests showed elevated carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels. A Whipple procedure was performed, which revealed a poorly differentiated pancreatic adenocarcinoma inside an intraductal pancreatic mucinous neoplasm. Postoperatively, the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) because he had no spontaneous breathing and manifested areflexia signs. A train of four (TOF) monitoring of peripheral nerve stimulation was performed and pyridostigmine therapy was initiated, leading to an improvement in symptoms allowing the extubation and transfer to the peripheral ward. Further diagnostic tests revealed a LEMS and an intravenous therapy with cumulative 100 g immunoglobulin (Ig) G was initiated. Upon discharge, 10 days after starting LEMS treatment, the patient showed subjective and objective improvement in strength. CONCLUSIONS: Paraneoplastic syndromes are more common than expected, but rare in pancreatic adenocarcinoma. They can appear before abdominal symptoms, facilitating early diagnosis. Successful treatment of cancer may eliminate paraneoplastic symptoms. LEMS may reveal pancreatic cancer. Early recognition of paraneoplastic syndromes is important for pancreatic cancer management. Further investigation is needed to evaluate the diagnostic approach for LEMS in all patients with pancreatic cancer.",,Zamparas A; Herzog T; Forster S; Siglienti I; Uhl W; Strotmann J; Hohn P,AME case reports,2023,,AME Case Rep. 2023 Aug 14;7:35. doi: 10.21037/acr-22-108. eCollection 2023.,China,518,10628391
39103810,"Surgical management of pancreatic cancer in Tikur Anbessa Specialized Hospital, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia: a 5 years retrospective descriptive study.","INTRODUCTION: The incidence of Pancreatic cancer is different in different parts of the world. It is a cancer with the worst prognosis of all malignancies. Pancreatic cancer is predominantly a disease of an older population. There are different environmental (modifiable) and non-modifiable risk factors associated with the development of pancreatic cancer. At present, surgical resection is the only potential cure for pancreatic cancer. However, as only 10-20% of the patients have resectable disease at the time of diagnosis. The morbidities associated with surgeries for pancreatic cancers remain high though the post-operative mortality has shown significant reduction in the past few decades. So far, no study has been conducted to investigate pancreatic cancer in Ethiopia. OBJECTIVES: To assess the clinico-pathologic profile, associated factors, surgical management and short-term outcome of patients with pancreatic cancer in Tikur Anbessa Specialized hospital. METHODS: A 5 years retrospective hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted on 52 patients operated with the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer with either curative or palliative intents. The study period was from April 2016 to July 2021. The data collected includes demographic profile, associated risk factors and comorbidities, clinical presentations, biochemical parameters, pathologic features of the tumors as well as type of treatment offered and short term treatment outcome. The data was analyzed using SPSS version 25. RESULT: The mean and median age of patients was 54.1 and 54.5% respectively. Males constitute about 52% the patients. 21% of the patients have potential risk factors; whereas only 10 (19.2%) of the patients had medical comorbidities. Median duration of symptoms at diagnosis was 12 weeks. Abdominal pain (88.5%) was the most common presenting symptom followed by anorexia (80.8%) and significant weight loss (78.8%), while 71.2% of the patients have jaundice. On clinical evaluation, 69.2% were jaundiced, while 34.6% had a palpable gallbladder. More than two third of patients presented with advanced disease. 76.9% of the tumors are located in the head of pancreas. More than three quarters (77%) of the surgeries performed were palliative. Postoperative morbidity and mortality were 19.2% and 3.8% respectively. CONCLUSION: Age at first diagnosis of pancreatic cancer is relatively earlier in our setup. Most patients present with advanced condition, only amenable for palliative measures. The post-operative morbidity and mortality are more or less comparable with similar studies. The need for adjuvant therapy in pancreatic cancer should be emphasized.","Humans; Ethiopia/epidemiology; *Pancreatic Neoplasms/surgery/diagnosis/epidemiology; Male; Retrospective Studies; Female; Middle Aged; Aged; Cross-Sectional Studies; Adult; Pancreatectomy/methods; Risk Factors; Aged, 80 and over; Treatment Outcome; Hospitals, Special/statistics & numerical data",Dinagde TA; Abubeker Z,BMC surgery,2024,Aug,BMC Surg. 2024 Aug 6;24(1):223. doi: 10.1186/s12893-024-02503-2.,England,522,11302827
34336696,Effectiveness of Carbon Ion Radiation in Locally Advanced Pancreatic Cancer.,"PURPOSE: Effective treatment strategies for unresectable locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC) patients are eagerly warranted. Recently, convincing oncological outcomes were demonstrated by carbon ion radiotherapy. Nevertheless, there is a lack of evidence for this modern radiation technique due to the limited number of carbon ion facilities worldwide. Here, we analyze feasibility and efficacy of carbon ion radiotherapy in the management of LAPC at Heidelberg Ion Beam Therapy Center (HIT). METHODS: Between 2015 and 2020, 21 LAPC patients were irradiated with carbon ions with a total dose of 48 Gy (RBE) in single doses of 4 Gy (RBE). Three patients (14%) were treated with concomitant chemotherapy with gemcitabine 300 mg/m(2) body surface weekly. Toxicity rates were extracted from the charts. Overall survival, progression free survival, local control, and locoregional control were evaluated using Kaplan-Meier estimates. RESULTS: One patient developed ascites CTCAE grade III during radiotherapy, which was related to a later histologically confirmed metachronous peritoneal carcinomatosis. No further higher-graded toxicity could be observed. The most common symptoms were nausea and abdominal pain. After a median estimated follow-up time of 19.1 months, the median progression free survival was 3.7 months, and the median overall survival was 11.9 months. The estimated 1-year local control and locoregional control rates were 89 and 84%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Carbon ion radiotherapy of LAPC patients is safely feasible. Local tumor control rates were high. Nevertheless, compared to historical data, an overall survival improvement could not be observed. This could be explained by the poor prognosis of the selected underlying patients that mostly did not respond to prior chemotherapy as well as the early and frequent emergence of distant metastases that demonstrate the necessity of additional chemotherapy in further studies.",,Liermann J; Naumann P; Weykamp F; Hoegen P; Debus J; Herfarth K,Frontiers in oncology,2021,,Front Oncol. 2021 Jul 14;11:708884. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2021.708884. eCollection 2021.,Switzerland,346,8318663
31377855,Early-onset pancreatic cancer: a population-based study using the SEER registry.,"BACKGROUND: Early-onset pancreatic cancer (< 50 years, EOPC) is uncommon and limited data exist on clinical presentation and long-term survival. The aim of this study was to compare outcomes between patients with EOPC and those with later-onset pancreatic cancer (>/= 50 years, LOPC) using a large population-based cohort. METHODS: The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database was queried to identify patients with a microscopically confirmed pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma for the period 2004 to 2016. Propensity score matching was used to compare overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) between patients with EOPC and LOPC. The EOPC and LOPC patients were paired 1:1 on propensity scores based on gender, tumor location, tumor size, AJCC stage, and treatment details. RESULTS: The overall cohort included 72,906 patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, including 4523 patients with EOPC (6.2%). EOPC patients were diagnosed at a more advanced AJCC stage (p < 0.001) compared with LOPC patients and received significantly more treatment, including surgery (p < 0.001), radiation (p < 0.001), and chemotherapy (p < 0.001). Following propensity score matching, 3172 EOPC patients were matched to 3172 LOPC patients, alleviating any covariate differences between the groups. The matched analysis showed that EOPC was associated with poorer 5-year OS (6.1% vs 8.6%, p = 0.003) and 5-year CSS (6.7% vs 9.7%, p < 0.001). In multivariable Cox regression analysis, EOPC remained significantly associated with adverse OS and CSS. Subgroup analyses showed that EOPC was associated with adverse 5-year OS (17.7% vs 26.9%, p < 0.001) and 5-year CSS (18.9% vs 29.7%, p < 0.001) in operated patients. After multivariable analysis, EOPC remained significantly associated with OS and CSS. For patients that did not undergo surgery, the OS and CSS remained dismal without any significant differences between the groups. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the largest study to compare the outcome of EOPC vs LOPC, as well as the first to use propensity score matching methodology for this purpose. The findings demonstrate that EOPC is diagnosed at a later stage and the matched survival analysis demonstrated reduced OS and CSS. We suggest that pancreatic cancer in young patients may have a unique tumor biology, which may be of importance for risk stratification and patient counseling.","Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Carcinoma, Pancreatic Ductal/*diagnosis/*epidemiology; Cohort Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Staging; Pancreatic Neoplasms/*diagnosis/*epidemiology; Propensity Score; SEER Program; Survival Analysis; United States",Ansari D; Althini C; Ohlsson H; Andersson R,Langenbeck's archives of surgery,2019,Aug,Langenbecks Arch Surg. 2019 Aug;404(5):565-571. doi: 10.1007/s00423-019-01810-0.

35576577,Nurses' Experiences Using an Interactive System to Assess and Manage Treatment-Related Symptoms of Patients With Pancreatic Cancer: Interview Study.,"BACKGROUND: Treatment for pancreatic cancer entails symptom distress and a high burden of self-care. Patient-reported outcomes, collected with the support of mobile health (mHealth), have shown positive effects on symptom management, patient satisfaction, and quality of life for patients with cancer. For mHealth tools to become an integral part of clinical routine, experiences from health care professionals are needed. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper is to describe nurses' experiences of integrating an interactive system (Interaktor) for symptom assessment and management into daily practice, when caring for patients following pancreaticoduodenectomy and during chemotherapy treatment due to pancreatic cancer. METHODS: Patients reported symptoms via the Interaktor app daily for 6 months. In the event of alarming symptoms, an alert was triggered to the patient's nurse who then called the patient to offer advice and support. All nurses (n=8) who assessed patients were interviewed either individually or in a group. Transcribed interviews were analyzed using qualitative thematic analysis. RESULTS: mHealth can facilitate person-centered care by offering nurses a way to gain knowledge about patients and to build relationships. Further, obstacles to implementation could be seen due to a lack of structural prerequisites and uncertainty about multiple ways to interact with patients. CONCLUSIONS: The Interaktor system can provide person-centered care. However, to implement mHealth tools as a clinical routine, focus needs to be placed on creating the necessary organizational conditions.",,Mangsbacka M; Gustavell T,JMIR nursing,2022,May,JMIR Nurs. 2022 May 16;5(1):e36654. doi: 10.2196/36654.,Canada,380,9152722
35706846,Application of Nanoparticles in Diagnosis and Treatment of Pancreatic Cancer.,"OBJECTIVE: In order to study the application of nanoparticles in the diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic cancer, we retrospectively analyzed pancreatic cancer patients after operation. METHOD: 60 cases of pancreatic cancer and surgical treatment were selected from our hospital. The time ranged from March 2018 to March 2019. The age ranged from 27 to 81 years. There were 36 males and 24 females, with an average age of 46.23 (7.63) years. Among them, the observation group consisted of nanotube artificial tubes, 16 males and 14 females, while the control group adopted nylon tube, male 18 and female 12. The patient was diagnosed by abdominal CT, and the patient's demographic data and basic clinical data were recorded at the same time. RESULT: In this study, 60 patients were divided into groups and compared. The patients underwent surgical resection of pancreaticoduodenum and reconstruction of pancreaticoduodenal papillary duct. Among them, the observation group used nanocomposite artificial tube, while the observation group used nanocomposite artificial tube and placed drainage tube to drain the peritoneal effusion to prevent the effusion from forming in abdominal hypertension and infection. The amount of postoperative bleeding, operation time, and postoperative concomitant symptoms were observed, and the differences between the two materials were analyzed. CONCLUSION: The reconstruction of pancreaticoduodenal papillary duct with nanomaterials has certain advantages for postoperative recovery, reduces postoperative complications, reduces the probability of infection, and improves the therapeutic effect.",,Yuan J; Wang Y; Cao Y; Yue S; Li X,Bioinorganic chemistry and applications,2022,,Bioinorg Chem Appl. 2022 Jun 6;2022:7803001. doi: 10.1155/2022/7803001. eCollection 2022.,United States,255,9192299
36110574,Clinical Study of Anti-PD-1 Immunotherapy Combined with Gemcitabine Chemotherapy in Multiline Treatment of Advanced Pancreatic Cancer.,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of anti-PD-1 immunotherapy combined with gemcitabine chemotherapy in multiline treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed on the clinical data of 32 patients with advanced pancreatic cancer treated with sintilimab regimen from January 2019 to December 2021 in our hospital. All patients were followed up until death or April 2022, in the form of outpatient, in-hospital review, or telephone follow-up. Follow-up content included routine blood, liver and kidney functions, tumor markers, plain or enhanced abdominal CT, and abdominal MRI examinations. Clinical efficacy was evaluated according to mRECIST criteria, and the severity of adverse effects was evaluated according to American Institute for Cancer Research (AICR) Standard Term for Adverse Events, Version 5.0. RESULTS: During treatment, the dosage of sintilimab was halved in 2 patients due to adverse reactions. All patients were treated with sintilimab for 1~10 times, with an average of 6 +/- 4 times. The total response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR) were 6.25% and 12.50% and 25.00% and 37.50%, respectively, after 1 and 3 months of treatment. The mean follow-up time of 32 patients was 1-12 months, and the median follow-up time was 4 +/- 3 months. By the end point of follow-up, a total of 25 patients died, and the median progression-free survival (PFS) was 3.8 (95% CI (1.85-5.63)) months. The median overall survival (OS) was 5.1 months (95% CI (3.63~7.68). After treatment, the levels of tumor markers CA125, CEA and CA199 were partly decreased compared with those before treatment (all P < 0.001). After treatment, the blood routine indexes d-dimer, CRP (C-reactive protein), NLR (neutral granulocyte to lymphocyte ratio), and MLR (monocyte to lymphocyte ratio) decreased compared with those before treatment. In 32 patients with advanced pancreatic cancer, the adverse reactions with an incidence more than 10% included fatigue, rash, hypothyroidism, hyperuricemia, and renal insufficiency. Only 2 patients showed grade 3 fatigue symptom, and all the others showed no adverse reactions of grades 3~5. In this study, all patients' adverse reactions were relieved after symptomatic treatment. CONCLUSION: Gemcitabine chemotherapy in multiline treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer with sintilimab can achieve certain clinical benefits without serious adverse reactions.",Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use; *C-Reactive Protein; Carcinoembryonic Antigen; *Deoxycytidine/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use; Fatigue; Humans; *Immunotherapy; *Pancreatic Neoplasms/drug therapy; Retrospective Studies; Gemcitabine,Liu Y; Li Y; Du S; Fan L; Wang J,Computational and mathematical methods in medicine,2022,,Comput Math Methods Med. 2022 Sep 6;2022:4070060. doi: 10.1155/2022/4070060. eCollection 2022.,United States,380,9470333
36751213,The Malignant Obstruction Caused by Pancreatic Cancer Within the Uncinate Process in the Third Portion of the Duodenum.,"Pancreatic cancer has a poor prognosis, and it often causes duodenal obstruction and obstructive jaundice associated with tumor invasion. Self-expandable metal stent (SEMS) placement is useful for duodenal obstruction. Pancreatic cancer can occur in the uncinate process, which may lead to malignant obstruction in the third portion of the duodenum. However, the upper gastrointestinal endoscope often cannot reach the third portion of the duodenum, and SEMS placement is sometimes difficult. We report a case of successful SEMS placement with a colonoscope for the obstruction of the third portion of the duodenum due to uncinate process cancer. A 67-year-old Japanese male was referred to our hospital for palliative treatment of unresectable pancreatic cancer. He complained of anorexia and vomiting and was admitted to our hospital. Computed tomography (CT) scans showed the tumor with delayed enhancement in the pancreatic uncinate process. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and gastrografin enema revealed the stenosis caused by tumor invasion in the third portion of the duodenum. The stenosis was thought to cause his symptom. PCFQ260AZ endoscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) was able to reach the stenosis, and a 22 mm x 80 mm uncovered SEMS (Niti-S, Taewoong Medical, Seoul, South Korea) was placed beyond the stenosis. After SEMS placement, his symptoms disappeared. Uncinate process cancer is located close to the third portion of the duodenum and caused the obstruction there. We should be cautious about this, and a colonoscope is useful for SEMS placement for malignant obstruction in the third portion of the duodenum.",,Inoue T,Cureus,2023,Jan,Cureus. 2023 Jan 6;15(1):e33436. doi: 10.7759/cureus.33436. eCollection 2023 Jan.,United States,299,9897716
30487695,"Pancreatic cancer: A review of clinical diagnosis, epidemiology, treatment and outcomes.","This review aims to outline the most up-to-date knowledge of pancreatic adenocarcinoma risk, diagnostics, treatment and outcomes, while identifying gaps that aim to stimulate further research in this understudied malignancy. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is a lethal condition with a rising incidence, predicted to become the second leading cause of cancer death in some regions. It often presents at an advanced stage, which contributes to poor five-year survival rates of 2%-9%, ranking firmly last amongst all cancer sites in terms of prognostic outcomes for patients. Better understanding of the risk factors and symptoms associated with this disease is essential to inform both health professionals and the general population of potential preventive and/or early detection measures. The identification of high-risk patients who could benefit from screening to detect pre-malignant conditions such as pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia, intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms and mucinous cystic neoplasms is urgently required, however an acceptable screening test has yet to be identified. The management of pancreatic adenocarcinoma is evolving, with the introduction of new surgical techniques and medical therapies such as laparoscopic techniques and neo-adjuvant chemoradiotherapy, however this has only led to modest improvements in outcomes. The identification of novel biomarkers is desirable to move towards a precision medicine era, where pancreatic cancer therapy can be tailored to the individual patient, while unnecessary treatments that have negative consequences on quality of life could be prevented for others. Research efforts must also focus on the development of new agents and delivery systems. Overall, considerable progress is required to reduce the burden associated with pancreatic cancer. Recent, renewed efforts to fund large consortia and research into pancreatic adenocarcinoma are welcomed, but further streams will be necessary to facilitate the momentum needed to bring breakthroughs seen for other cancer sites.","Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use; Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis; Carcinoma, Pancreatic Ductal/*diagnosis/epidemiology/pathology/*therapy; Chemoradiotherapy, Adjuvant/methods; Early Detection of Cancer/methods; Humans; Incidence; Mass Screening/methods; Neoadjuvant Therapy/methods; Pancreas/pathology/surgery; Pancreatectomy/methods; Pancreatic Neoplasms/*diagnosis/epidemiology/pathology/*therapy; Precancerous Conditions/*diagnosis/epidemiology/pathology; Prognosis; Quality of Life; Risk Factors; Survival Rate; Treatment Outcome",McGuigan A; Kelly P; Turkington RC; Jones C; Coleman HG; McCain RS,World journal of gastroenterology,2018,Nov,World J Gastroenterol. 2018 Nov 21;24(43):4846-4861. doi: 10.3748/wjg.v24.i43.4846.,United States,365,6250924
39880447,Lived experiences of patients with advanced pancreatic cancer on patient-reported outcomes (PROs) management: a qualitative phenomenological study in Southwest China.,"OBJECTIVES: To explore the lived experiences of patients with advanced pancreatic cancer enrolled in a patient-reported outcomes (PROs) management programme and to preliminarily understand how PROs management influences various aspects of patient care and overall quality of life. DESIGN: A qualitative phenomenological study. SETTING: A national cancer care centre in Southwest China specialised in cancer care, with a comprehensive PROs management programme. PARTICIPANTS: 15 participants diagnosed with advanced pancreatic cancer. RESULTS: Five key themes emerged from our interviews, including enhanced communication with healthcare providers, attributed to the structured nature of PROs; increased perceived sense of care, with patients feeling more valued and heard; PROs management facilitated better treatment decision-making, with patients feeling more involved and empowered; improved communication with family members, aiding in better understanding and support; and varied perceptions of the impact on quality of life, with some noting improvements in specific aspects like symptom management, while others were uncertain about the overall benefit. CONCLUSIONS: PROs management plays a significant role in improving communication between patients with advanced pancreatic cancer and their healthcare providers, enhancing patients' involvement in treatment decisions, and potentially improving family dynamics. However, the impact of PROs management on the overall quality of life of patients remains complex and individualised. The findings suggest that further research with a more diverse patient population is needed to fully understand the implications of PROs management in advanced cancer care.",Humans; *Pancreatic Neoplasms/therapy/psychology; *Patient Reported Outcome Measures; China; Qualitative Research; Male; Female; *Quality of Life; Middle Aged; Aged; Communication; Adult; Decision Making; Interviews as Topic,Chen P; Hou W; Li C; Liang Q; Ma L; Zhao X; Yi C,BMJ open,2025,Jan,BMJ Open. 2025 Jan 28;15(1):e084259. doi: 10.1136/bmjopen-2024-084259.,England,372,11781101
28425921,Plasma Micro-RNA Alterations Appear Late in Pancreatic Cancer.,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this research was to study whether plasma microRNAs (miRNA) can be used for early detection of pancreatic cancer (PC) by analyzing prediagnostic plasma samples collected before a PC diagnosis. BACKGROUND: PC has a poor prognosis due to late presenting symptoms and early metastasis. Circulating miRNAs are altered in PC at diagnosis but have not been evaluated in a prediagnostic setting. METHODS: We first performed an initial screen using a panel of 372 miRNAs in a retrospective case-control cohort that included early-stage PC patients and healthy controls. Significantly altered miRNAs at diagnosis were then measured in an early detection case-control cohort wherein plasma samples in the cases are collected before a PC diagnosis. Carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (Ca 19-9) levels were measured in all samples for comparison. RESULTS: Our initial screen, including 23 stage I-II PC cases and 22 controls, revealed 15 candidate miRNAs that were differentially expressed in plasma samples at PC diagnosis. We combined all 15 miRNAs into a multivariate statistical model, which outperformed Ca 19-9 in receiver-operating characteristics analysis. However, none of the candidate miRNAs, individually or in combination, were significantly altered in prediagnostic plasma samples from 67 future PC patients compared with 132 matched controls. In comparison, Ca 19-9 levels were significantly higher in the cases at <5 years before diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Plasma miRNAs are altered in PC patients at diagnosis, but the candidate miRNAs found in this study appear late in the course of the disease and cannot be used for early detection of the disease.","Aged; Bilirubin/blood; Biomarkers, Tumor/*blood; CA-19-9 Antigen/blood; Case-Control Studies; *Early Detection of Cancer; Female; Humans; Male; MicroRNAs/*blood; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Pancreatic Neoplasms/blood/*diagnosis; Retrospective Studies",Franklin O; Jonsson P; Billing O; Lundberg E; Ohlund D; Nystrom H; Lundin C; Antti H; Sund M,Annals of surgery,2018,Apr,Ann Surg. 2018 Apr;267(4):775-781. doi: 10.1097/SLA.0000000000002124.,United States,285,5865497
30254746,Pre-diagnostic delays caused by gastrointestinal investigations do not affect outcomes in pancreatic cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas are poor prognostic cancers accounting for 3% of all cancer cases in the UK. They often present late in the course of the disease process with non-specific symptoms, including gastro-intestinal(GI) symptoms. Delays in diagnosis occur when investigations are carried out in a primary care setting for GI symptoms. The aim of this study was to assess delays in pancreatic cancer diagnosis when patients were referred for GI investigations and evaluate its effect on survival. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of all patients diagnosed with pancreatic adenocarcinoma in a Scottish district general hospital over a seven year period from January 2010 to December 2016. Patients were divided into two groups, those who had a GI investigation 18 months prior to the pancreatic cancer diagnosis and those who did not have GI investigations. Data on demographics, symptoms on referral, stage of disease at diagnosis, treatment undergone and length of survival collected and analysed. RESULTS: One hundred and fifty-three patients were diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in the study period. Forty (26%) of the 153 underwent gastrointestinal investigations in the 18 months prior to diagnosis. The remaining 113 (74%) had no gastro-intestinal investigations in the same time period. Demographic data were comparable. Significant delays occurred from referral to diagnosis in the GI investigated group compared to those who did not have GI investigations. (64.5days vs 9 days, p = 0.001). No difference was noted in disease stage or treatments undergone between the groups. There was no difference in the average survival after diagnosis between the two groups with median of 108 days for those who underwent GI investigations to 97 days for those who did not.(U = 2079.5, p = 0.454). CONCLUSION: Delays caused by pre-diagnostic GI investigations do not appear to contribute to the poor prognosis of pancreatic cancer. Recently updated NICE Guidelines recommends early ultrasound or CT in patients with GI symptoms and weight loss which may reduce delays in diagnosis. Screening tests in future may become cost effective and diagnose this condition at a curable stage which in turn may improve survival rates.",,Apollos JR; Sami S; Prasanth MN; Jeyakumar J; McFadyen AK,Annals of medicine and surgery (2012),2018,Oct,Ann Med Surg (Lond). 2018 Sep 10;34:66-70. doi: 10.1016/j.amsu.2018.07.011. eCollection 2018 Oct.,England,607,6149195
35666369,A case of radical resection for brain metastases of pancreatic cancer after curative chemotherapy for para-aortic lymph node metastases.,"BACKGROUND: The incidence of brain metastasis of pancreatic cancer has been reported to be approximately 0.3%. The blood-brain barrier of the central nervous system restricts the transfer of substances, including chemotherapeutic agents, from the bloodstream. It is hypothesized that brain metastasis may occur despite successful chemotherapy for the primary tumor. Herein, we report a case of brain metastases of pancreatic cancer that occurred after chemotherapy and discuss relevant literature. CASE PRESENTATION: A 64-year-old man underwent distal pancreatectomy with D2 lymph node dissection for resectable pancreatic tail cancer. Invasive ductal carcinoma of pancreas, pT3N2M0 pStageIII (TNM Classification of Malignant Tumors, UICC 8th edition) was diagnosed. S-1 adjuvant chemotherapy was initiated. Three months postoperatively, CA19-9 had increased to 619 U/mL. Additionally, contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) and fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET)/CT revealed local recurrence in the para-aortic lymph nodes. Chemotherapy was revised to a combined regimen of gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel. After 4 cycles, tumor markers were normalized. After 5 cycles, recurrence could not be identified on contrast-enhanced CT; therefore, the patient was adjudged to be in complete remission. However, after 29 cycles of chemotherapy, the patient had symptoms of raised intracranial pressure. Magnetic resonance imaging showed two metastatic lesions of 20 mm and 32 mm in the left frontal lobe and cerebellum, respectively. Quasi-emergency resection of the metastatic brain tumors was performed. Pathological examination revealed that the resected specimens originated from primary pancreatic cancer. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 12, without any complications. Postoperatively, a total of 53 Gy of local brain radiation therapy was added. On postoperative day 30, blood carcinoembryonic antigen level had decreased to 5.4 ng/dl and all other tumor markers were negative. Additionally, tumor markers of the cerebrospinal fluid were markedly reduced and the cytology was negative for tumor cells. These results suggested complete resection of the metastatic brain tumors. CONCLUSIONS: Aggressive resection and salvage stereotactic radiotherapy for metastatic brain tumors may lead to complete cure and a good long-term prognosis.",,Utsunomiya T; Funamizu N; Ozaki E; Tamura K; Sakamoto K; Ogawa K; Kusakabe K; Suehiro S; Yamashita D; Kurata M; Kitazawa R; Takada Y,Surgical case reports,2022,Jun,Surg Case Rep. 2022 Jun 6;8(1):108. doi: 10.1186/s40792-022-01461-2.,Japan,394,9170865
30288172,Association between chronological depressive changes and physical symptoms in postoperative pancreatic cancer patients.,"BACKGROUND: Pancreatic cancer (PC) has poorer prognosis and higher surgical invasiveness than many other cancers, with associated psychiatric symptoms including depression and anxiety. Perioperative depression has not been investigated in PC patients regarding surgical stress and relevant interventions. METHODS: We evaluated chronological depressive changes and subjective physical symptoms in surgically treated PC patients preoperatively and at 3 and 6 months postoperatively.Enrolled patients undergoing pancreatic tumor surgery completed questionnaires based on the Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy for Patients with Hepatobiliary Cancer (FACT-Hep) preoperatively, and at 3 and 6 months postoperatively. Responses were analyzed with JMP(R) Pro using one-way and two-way ANOVA, Spearman's rank correlation coefficient, and multiple regression analysis. RESULTS: Malignancy was diagnosed in 73 of 101 patients postoperatively; SDS score was significantly higher in these patients than in those with benign tumors at all timepoints: malignant/benign, 41.8/37.9 preoperatively (p = 0.004); 43.5/37.8 3 months postoperatively (p = 0.006); and 42.9/37.7 6 months postoperatively (p = 0.020). SDS scores were significantly higher in patients < 65 years old with malignancy at 3 months than at 6 months postoperatively (44.6/42.5, p = 0.046) and in patients with malignancy who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy at 3 months postoperatively than preoperatively (43.4/41.1; p = 0.028). SDS scores moderately correlated with 8 physical symptom-related FACT-Hep items 3 months postoperatively (p < 0.05), showing low-to-moderate correlation with 16 physical symptom-related FACT-Hep items at 6 months postoperatively (p < 0.05). Multiple regression analysis of FACT-Hep symptoms significantly correlated with SDS scores revealed the following significant variables: ""lack of energy"" (p < 0.000) and ""pain"" (p = 0.018) preoperatively (R(2) = 0.43); ""able to perform usual activities"" (p = 0.031) and ""lack of energy"" (p < 0.000) at 3 months postoperatively (R(2) = 0.51); and ""stomach swelling or cramps"" (p = 0.034) and ""bowel control"" (p = 0.049) at 6 months postoperatively (R(2) = 0.52).

33513833,TFEB Supports Pancreatic Cancer Growth through the Transcriptional Regulation of Glutaminase.,"Transcription factor EB (TFEB) is a master regulator of lysosomal function and autophagy. In addition, TFEB has various physiological roles such as nutrient sensing, cellular stress responses, and immune responses. However, the precise roles of TFEB in pancreatic cancer growth remain unclear. Here, we show that pancreatic cancer cells exhibit a significantly elevated TFEB expression compared with normal tissue samples and that the genetic inhibition of TFEB results in a significant inhibition in both glutamine and mitochondrial metabolism, which in turn suppresses the PDAC growth both in vitro and in vivo. High basal levels of autophagy are critical for pancreatic cancer growth. The TFEB knockdown had no significant effect on the autophagic flux under normal conditions but interestingly caused a profound reduction in glutaminase (GLS) transcription, leading to an inhibition of glutamine metabolism. We observed that the direct binding of TFEB to the GLS and TFEB gene promotors regulates the transcription of GLS. We also found that the glutamate supplementation leads to a significant recovery of the PDAC growth that had been reduced by a TFEB knockdown. Taken together, our current data demonstrate that TFEB supports the PDAC cell growth by regulating glutaminase-mediated glutamine metabolism.",,Kim JH; Lee J; Cho YR; Lee SY; Sung GJ; Shin DM; Choi KC; Son J,Cancers,2021,Jan,Cancers (Basel). 2021 Jan 27;13(3):483. doi: 10.3390/cancers13030483.,Switzerland,403,7865852

METHODS: We conducted a case-control study on 29,646 Medicare-enrolled patients aged 68 years and above with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) reported to the Surveillance Epidemiology an End Results (SEER) tumor registries program in 2004-2011 and 88,938 age and sex-matched controls. We developed a prediction model using multivariable logistic regression on Medicare claims for 16 risk factors and pre-diagnostic symptoms of PDAC present within 15 months prior to PDAC diagnosis. Claims within 3 months of PDAC diagnosis were excluded in sensitivity analyses. We evaluated the discriminatory power of the model with the area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) and performed cross-validation by bootstrapping. RESULTS: The prediction model on all cases and controls reached AUC of 0.68. Excluding the final 3 months of claims lowered the AUC to 0.58. Among new-onset diabetes patients, the prediction model reached AUC of 0.73, which decreased to 0.63 when claims from the final 3 months were excluded. Performance measures of the prediction models was confirmed by internal validation using the bootstrap method. CONCLUSION: Models based on healthcare claims for clinical risk factors, symptoms and signs of pancreatic cancer are limited in classifying those who go on to diagnosis of pancreatic cancer and those who do not, especially when excluding claims that immediately precede the diagnosis of PDAC.","Adenocarcinoma/*diagnosis/epidemiology; Administrative Claims, Healthcare/*statistics & numerical data; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; *Health Status; Humans; Male; Models, Statistical; Pancreatic Neoplasms/*diagnosis/epidemiology; Undiagnosed Diseases/*diagnosis/epidemiology",Baecker A; Kim S; Risch HA; Nuckols TK; Wu BU; Hendifar AE; Pandol SJ; Pisegna JR; Jeon CY,PloS one,2019,,PLoS One. 2019 Jun 25;14(6):e0218580. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0218580. eCollection 2019.,United States,374,6592596
33275621,"Survival features, prognostic factors, and determinants of diagnosis and treatment among Iranian patients with pancreatic cancer, a prospective study.","OBJECTIVES: Investigating the survival features, and determinants of treatment and stage at presentation in Iran. METHODS: 461 patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PC) were prospectively enrolled from Shariati hospital, Tehran, Iran, between 2011-2018. All patients underwent endoscopic ultrasonography, computed tomography scanning, and physical examination. Validated questionnaire was completed for the participants and all were actively followed on monthly basis. RESULTS: Median survival time was 6.5 months, and 1-, and 5-year survival rates were 26.2%, and 1.5%. Patients who were older (p<0.001), illiterate (p = 0.004), unmarried (p = 0.003), rural inhabitant (p = 0.013), opium user (p = 0.039), and had lower body mass index (BMI) (p = 0.002) had lower overall survival. Tumors located in the head of pancreas were more commonly diagnosed at lower stages (p<0.001). Only 10.4% of patients underwent surgery who were more commonly educated (p<0.001), married (p = 0.005), had a tumor located in the head of pancreas (p = 0.016), and were diagnosed at lower stages (p<0.001). After adjustment for potential confounders and risk factors, rural inhabitance (HR: 1.33 (95% CI: 1.01-1.74)), having more symptoms (HR for each increasing symptom: 1.06 (1.02-1.11)), using opium (HR: 1.51 (1.04-2.20)), having a tumor located in the body of pancreas (HR: 1.33 (1.02-1.75)), and having an advanced tumor stage (HR: 2.07 (1.34-3.19)) remained significantly associated with increased risk of mortality. After the adjusting for potential confounders, we did not find significant relationships between smoking, alcohol intake, and BMI with the risk of death among patients with pancreatic cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Iranian patients with PC have very poor long-term survival. Besides tumor's stage and location, socioeconomic disparities could affect the probabilities of receiving treatment and/or survival in these patients. Opium use is an independent risk factor for mortality among PC patients in Iran.","Adult; Aged; Alcohol Drinking; Body Mass Index; Carcinoma, Pancreatic Ductal/epidemiology/mortality; Female; Humans; Iran/epidemiology; Male; Middle Aged; Opium Dependence; Pancreas/pathology; Pancreatic Neoplasms/*diagnosis/*epidemiology/*mortality/pathology; Prognosis; Prospective Studies; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Smoking; Survival Rate",Sheikh M; Masoudi S; Bakhshandeh R; Moayyedkazemi A; Zamani F; Nikfam S; Mansouri M; Shishavan NG; Nikeghbalian S; Brennan P; Malekzadeh R; Pourshams A,PloS one,2020,,PLoS One. 2020 Dec 4;15(12):e0243511. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0243511. eCollection 2020.,United States,380,7717574
33733091,Pancreatic Cancer Prediction Through an Artificial Neural Network.,"Early detection of pancreatic cancer is challenging because cancer-specific symptoms occur only at an advanced stage, and a reliable screening tool to identify high-risk patients is lacking. To address this challenge, an artificial neural network (ANN) was developed, trained, and tested using the health data of 800,114 respondents captured in the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) and Pancreatic, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian cancer (PLCO) datasets, together containing 898 patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. Prediction of pancreatic cancer risk was assessed at an individual level by incorporating 18 features into the neural network. The established ANN model achieved a sensitivity of 87.3 and 80.7%, a specificity of 80.8 and 80.7%, and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.86 and 0.85 for the training and testing cohorts, respectively. These results indicate that our ANN can be used to predict pancreatic cancer risk with high discriminatory power and may provide a novel approach to identify patients at higher risk for pancreatic cancer who may benefit from more tailored screening and intervention.",,Muhammad W; Hart GR; Nartowt B; Farrell JJ; Johung K; Liang Y; Deng J,Frontiers in artificial intelligence,2019,,Front Artif Intell. 2019 May 3;2:2. doi: 10.3389/frai.2019.00002. eCollection 2019.,Switzerland,271,7861334
24809702,Targeting insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor inhibits pancreatic cancer growth and metastasis.,"Pancreatic cancer is one of the most lethal cancers. Increasing incidence and mortality indicates that there is still much lacking in detection and management of the disease. This is partly due to a lack of specific symptoms during early stages of the disease. Several growth factor receptors have been associated with pancreatic cancer. Here, we have investigated if an RNA interference approach targeted to IGF-IR could be effective and efficient against pancreatic cancer growth and metastasis. For that, we evaluated the effects of IGF-1R inhibition using small interfering RNA (siRNAs) on tumor growth and metastasis in HPAC and PANC-1 pancreatic cancer cell lines. We found that silencing IGF-1R inhibits pancreatic cancer growth and metastasis by blocking key signaling pathways such AKT/PI3K, MAPK, JAK/STAT and EMT. Silencing IGF-1R resulted in an anti-proliferative effect in PANC-1 and HPAC pancreatic cancer cell lines. Matrigel invasion, transwell migration and wound healing assays also revealed a role for IGF-1R in metastatic properties of pancreatic cancer. These results were further confirmed using Western blotting analysis of key intermediates involved in proliferation, epithelial mesenchymal transition, migration, and invasion. In addition, soft agar assays showed that silencing IGF-1R also blocks the colony forming capabilities of pancreatic cancer cells in vitro. Western blots, as well as, flow cytometric analysis revealed the induction of apoptosis in IGF-1R silenced cells. Interestingly, silencing IGF-1R also suppressed the expression of insulin receptor beta. All these effects together significantly control pancreatic cancer cell growth and metastasis. To conclude, our results demonstrate the significance of IGF-1R in pancreatic cancer.","Apoptosis/genetics; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Movement/genetics; Cell Proliferation; Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition/genetics; Gene Knockdown Techniques; Humans; MAP Kinase Signaling System/genetics; *Molecular Targeted Therapy; Neoplasm Invasiveness; Neoplasm Metastasis; Pancreatic Neoplasms/genetics/*pathology; RNA Interference; RNA, Small Interfering/genetics; Receptor, IGF Type 1/*deficiency/*genetics",Subramani R; Lopez-Valdez R; Arumugam A; Nandy S; Boopalan T; Lakshmanaswamy R,PloS one,2014,,PLoS One. 2014 May 8;9(5):e97016. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0097016. eCollection 2014.,United States,398,4014591
39020414,The cross-talk between the macro and micro-environment in precursor lesions of pancreatic cancer leads to new and promising circulating biomarkers.,"Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a clinically challenging tumor to combat due to its advanced stage at diagnosis as well as its resistance to currently available therapies. The absence of early symptoms and known detectable biomarkers renders this disease incredibly difficult to detect/manage. Recent advances in the understanding of PC biology have highlighted the importance of cancer-immune cell interactions, not only in the tumor micro-environment but also in distant systemic sites, like the bone marrow, spleen and circulating immune cells, the so-called macro-environment. The response of the macro-environment is emerging as a determining factor in tumor development by contributing to the formation of an increasingly immunogenic micro-environment promoting tumor homeostasis and progression. We will summarize the key events associated with the feedback loop between the tumor immune micro-environment (TIME) and the tumor immune macroenvironment (TIMaE) in pancreatic precancerous lesions along with how it regulates disease development and progression. In addition, liquid biopsy biomarkers capable of diagnosing PC at an early stage of onset will also be discussed. A clearer understanding of the early crosstalk between micro-environment and macro-environment could contribute to identifying new molecular therapeutic targets and biomarkers, consequently improving early PC diagnosis and treatment.","Humans; *Pancreatic Neoplasms/pathology/blood/metabolism; *Biomarkers, Tumor/blood; *Tumor Microenvironment; Precancerous Conditions/pathology/metabolism/blood; Disease Progression",Mottini C; Auciello FR; Manni I; Pilarsky C; Caputo D; Caracciolo G; Rossetta A; Di Gennaro E; Budillon A; Blandino G; Roca MS; Piaggio G,Journal of experimental & clinical cancer research : CR,2024,Jul,J Exp Clin Cancer Res. 2024 Jul 18;43(1):198. doi: 10.1186/s13046-024-03117-5.,England,409,11256648
36156926,Previous hepatitis B viral infection-an underestimated cause of pancreatic cancer.,"BACKGROUND: The etiology of pancreatic cancer remains unclear. This limits the possibility of prevention and effective treatment. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is responsible for the development of different types of cancer, but its role in pancreatic cancer is still being discussed. AIM: To assess the prevalence of previous HBV infection and to identify viral biomarkers in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) to support the role of the virus in etiology of this cancer. METHODS: The data of 130 hepatitis B surface antigen-negative subjects were available for the final analysis, including 60 patients with PDAC confirmed by cytology or histology and 70 sex- and age-matched controls. All the participants were tested for HBV biomarkers in blood [antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc), antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs) and HBV DNA], and for those with PDAC, biomarkers in resected pancreatic tissues were tested (HBV DNA, HBV pregenomic RNA and covalently closed circular DNA). We performed immunohistochemistry staining of pancreatic tissues for hepatitis B virus X antigen and Ki-67 protein. Non-parametric statistics were used for the analysis. RESULTS: Anti-HBc was detected in 18/60 (30%) patients with PDAC and in 9/70 (13%) participants in the control group (P = 0.029). Accordingly, the odds of PDAC in anti-HBc-positive subjects were higher compared to those with no previous HBV infection (odds ratio: 2.905, 95% confidence interval: 1.191-7.084, standard error 0.455). HBV DNA was detected in 8 cases of PDAC and in 6 of them in the pancreatic tumor tissue samples only (all patients were anti-HBc positive). Blood HBV DNA was negative in all subjects of the control group with positive results of the serum anti-HBc test. Among 9 patients with PDAC, 5 revealed signs of replicative competence of the virus (covalently closed circular DNA with or without pregenomic RNA) in the pancreatic tumor tissue samples. Hepatitis B virus X antigen expression and active cell proliferation was revealed by immunohistochemistry in 4 patients with PDAC in the pancreatic tumor tissue samples. CONCLUSION: We found significantly higher risks of PDAC in anti-HBc-positive patients. Detection of viral replication and hepatitis B virus X protein expression in the tumor tissue prove involvement of HBV infection in pancreatic cancer development.","*Carcinoma, Pancreatic Ductal/epidemiology; DNA, Circular; DNA, Viral; *Hepatitis B/complications/diagnosis/epidemiology; Hepatitis B Antibodies; Hepatitis B Core Antigens; Hepatitis B Surface Antigens; Hepatitis B virus/genetics; Humans; Ki-67 Antigen/genetics; *Pancreatic Neoplasms/epidemiology; RNA",Batskikh S; Morozov S; Dorofeev A; Borunova Z; Kostyushev D; Brezgin S; Kostyusheva A; Chulanov V,World journal of gastroenterology,2022,Sep,World J Gastroenterol. 2022 Sep 7;28(33):4812-4822. doi: 10.3748/wjg.v28.i33.4812.,United States,438,9476854
34498718,Metastatic pancreatic cancer: Mechanisms and detection (Review).,"Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a lethal malignancy. Its prevalence rate remains low but continues to grow each year. Among all stages of PC, metastatic PC is defined as late‑stage (stage IV) PC and has an even higher fatality rate. Patients with PC do not have any specific clinical manifestations. Most cases are inoperable at the time‑point of diagnosis. Prognosis is also poor even with curative‑intent surgery. Complications during surgery, postoperative pancreatic fistula and recurrence with metastatic foci make the management of metastatic PC difficult. While extensive efforts were made to improve survival outcomes, further elucidation of the molecular mechanisms of metastasis poses a formidable challenge. The present review provided an overview of the mechanisms of metastatic PC, summarizing currently known signaling pathways (e.g. epithelial‑mesenchymal transition, NF‑kappaB and KRAS), imaging that may be utilized for early detection and biomarkers (e.g. carbohydrate antigen 19‑9, prostate cancer‑associated transcript‑1, F‑box/LRR‑repeat protein 7 and tumor stroma), giving insight into promising therapeutic targets.","Biomarkers, Tumor; Early Detection of Cancer/*methods; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neoplasm Metastasis/*diagnostic imaging/*pathology; Pancreatic Neoplasms/*diagnostic imaging/*pathology; Tomography, X-Ray Computed",Chen X; Liu F; Xue Q; Weng X; Xu F,Oncology reports,2021,Nov,Oncol Rep. 2021 Nov;46(5):231. doi: 10.3892/or.2021.8182.

Borderline resectable pancreatic cancer (BRPC) is a specific clinical presentation with features in between those of resectable and locally advanced pancreatic cancers. The classification of pancreatic cancer is an important issue given that a cancer may look resectable but be high-risk for R1 or R2 resection. Considering that margin-negative resection is a fundamental requirement for curing pancreatic cancer, this issue is one of the most interesting to pancreatic surgeons.

40430018,Identification of Cancer Associated Fibroblasts Related Genes Signature to Facilitate Improved Prediction of Prognosis and Responses to Therapy in Patients with Pancreatic Cancer.,"Pancreatic cancer (PC) is highly aggressive, with a 5-year survival rate of 12.8%, making early detection vital. However, non-specific symptoms and precursor lesions complicate diagnosis. Existing tools for the early detection of PC are limited. CAFs are crucial in cancer progression, invasion, and metastasis, yet their role in PC is poorly understood. This study analyzes mRNA data from PC samples to identify CAF-related genes and drugs for PC treatment using algorithms like EPIC, xCell, MCP-counter, and TIDE to quantify CAF infiltration. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) identified 26 hub genes. Our analyses revealed eight prognostic genes, leading to establishing a six-gene model for assessing prognosis. Correlation analysis showed that the CAF risk score correlates with CAF infiltration and related markers. We also identified six potential drugs, observing significant differences between high-CAF and low-CAF risk groups. High CAF risk scores were associated with lower responses to immunotherapy and higher tumor mutation burdens. GSEA indicated that these scores are enriched in tumor microenvironment pathways. In summary, these six model genes can predict overall survival and responses to chemotherapy and immunotherapy for pancreatic cancer, offering valuable insights for future clinical strategies.","Humans; *Pancreatic Neoplasms/genetics/pathology/therapy; Prognosis; Tumor Microenvironment/genetics; *Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts/metabolism/pathology; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; *Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics; Gene Regulatory Networks; Gene Expression Profiling; *Transcriptome; Immunotherapy",Zhou Y; Lu Y; Czubayko F; Chen J; Zheng S; Mo H; Liu R; Weber GF; Grutzmann R; Pilarsky C; David P,International journal of molecular sciences,2025,May,Int J Mol Sci. 2025 May 19;26(10):4876. doi: 10.3390/ijms26104876.,Switzerland,341,12112120
34457189,Helicobacter pylori infection and other bacteria in pancreatic cancer and autoimmune pancreatitis.,"Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is an infectious agent influencing as much as 50% of the world's population. It is the causative agent for several diseases, most especially gastric and duodenal peptic ulcer, gastric adenocarcinoma and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma of the stomach. A number of other, extragastric manifestations also are associated with H. pylori infection. These include neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, demyelinating multiple sclerosis and Parkinson's disease. There is also evidence for a relationship between H. pylori infection and such dermatological diseases as psoriasis and rosacea as well as a connection with infection and open-angle glaucoma. Generally little is known about the relationship between H. pylori infection and diseases of the pancreas. Most evidence about H. pylori and its potential role in the development of pancreatic diseases concerns pancreatic adenocarcinoma and autoimmune forms of chronic pancreatitis. There is data (albeit not fully consistent) indicating modestly increased pancreatic cancer risk in H. pylori-positive patients. The pathogenetic mechanism of this increase is not yet fully elucidated, but several theories have been proposed. Reduction of antral D-cells in H. pylori-positive patients causes a suppression of somatostatin secretion that, in turn, stimulates increased secretin secretion. That stimulates pancreatic growth and thus increases the risk of carcinogenesis. Alternatively, H. pylori, as a part of microbiome dysbiosis and the so-called oncobiome, is proven to be associated with pancreatic adenocarcinoma development via the promotion of cellular proliferation. The role of H. pylori in the inflammation characteristic of autoimmune pancreatitis seems to be explained by a mechanism of molecular mimicry among several proteins (mostly enzymes) of H. pylori and pancreatic tissue. Patients with autoimmune pancreatitis often show positivity for antibodies against H. pylori proteins. H. pylori, as a part of microbiome dysbiosis, also is viewed as a potential trigger of autoimmune inflammation of the pancreas. It is precisely these relationships (and associated equivocal conclusions) that constitute a center of attention among pancreatologists, immunologists and pathologists. In order to obtain clear and valid results, more studies on sufficiently large cohorts of patients are needed. The topic is itself sufficiently significant to draw the interest of clinicians and inspire further systematic research. Next-generation sequencing could play an important role in investigating the microbiome as a potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for pancreatic cancer.",,Kunovsky L; Dite P; Jabandziev P; Dolina J; Vaculova J; Blaho M; Bojkova M; Dvorackova J; Uvirova M; Kala Z; Trna J,World journal of gastrointestinal oncology,2021,Aug,World J Gastrointest Oncol. 2021 Aug 15;13(8):835-844. doi: 10.4251/wjgo.v13.i8.835.,China,706,8371525
38827122,Disseminated intravascular coagulation after cryoablation for metastatic pancreatic cancer: a case report.,"BACKGROUND: Pancreatic cancer is the fourth most common cause of cancer-related death in the United States. Despite advancements in surgery and chemoradiation therapies, pancreatic cancer has a 5-year survival rate of only 11% in the United States. Cryoablation is emerging as a new and effective therapy for locally advanced pancreatic cancer and symptom palliation in metastatic disease. To our knowledge, the occurrence of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) after cryoablation is rare. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 47-year-old woman with no significant past medical history was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and underwent a Whipple procedure followed by chemotherapy with gemcitabine and paclitaxel. Due to the abdominal lymph nodes, peritoneum, right femur, and surrounding soft tissue metastases, she received systemic palliative chemotherapy with gemcitabine and paclitaxel and underwent right femur tumor excision, open reduction, and internal fixation, followed by radiation therapy. She continued to have persistent pain and underwent palliative percutaneous cryoablation of the metastatic tumor under computed tomography (CT) and ultrasound guidance. Immediately post procedure, she developed slow but continuous blood oozing at the ablation site, which was difficult to control despite compression dressings, reinforcement sutures, and local thrombin powder. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit where she was noted to be hypotensive and tachycardic, with petechiae in both lower extremities. Laboratory studies were consistent with DIC and peripheral blood smear revealed multiple schistocytes. CT angiogram of the right lower extremity did not show any bleeding vessel amenable to embolization. She was transfused red blood cells, platelets, fresh frozen plasma, and cryoprecipitate. Despite multiple daily transfusions, she continued to have pain and remained persistently thrombocytopenic and coagulopathic. After discussion with the patient and her family, she chose to transition to comfort care measures and died.

28388966,Vaccination with poly(IC:LC) and peptide-pulsed autologous dendritic cells in patients with pancreatic cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Dendritic cells (DCs) enhance the quality of anti-tumor immune response in patients with cancer. Thus, we posit that DC-based immunotherapy, in conjunction with toll-like receptor (TLR)-3 agonist poly-ICLC, is a promising approach for harnessing immunity against metastatic or locally advanced unresectable pancreatic cancer (PC). METHODS: We generated autologous DCs from the peripheral blood of HLA-A2(+) patients with PC. DCs were pulsed with three distinct A2-restricted peptides: 1) human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT, TERT572Y), 2) carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA; Cap1-6D), and 3) survivin (SRV.A2). Patients received four intradermal injections of 1 x 10(7) peptide-pulsed DC vaccines every 2 weeks (Day 0, 14, 28, and 42). Concurrently, patients received intramuscular administration of Poly-ICLC at 30 mug/Kg on vaccination days (i.e., day 0, 14, 28, and 42), as well as on days 3, 17, 21, 31, 37, and 45. Our key objective was to assess safety and feasibility. The effect of DC vaccination on immune response was measured at each DC injection time point by enumerating the phenotype and function of patient T cells. RESULTS: Twelve patients underwent apheresis: nine patients with metastatic disease, and three patients with locally advanced unresectable disease. Vaccines were successfully manufactured from all individuals. We found that this treatment was well-tolerated, with the most common symptoms being fatigue and/or self-limiting flu-like symptoms. Among the eight patients who underwent imaging on day 56, four patients experienced stable disease while four patients had disease progression. The median overall survival was 7.7 months. One patient survived for 28 months post leukapheresis. MHC class I -tetramer analysis before and after vaccination revealed effective generation of antigen-specific T cells in three patients with stable disease. CONCLUSION: Vaccination with peptide-pulsed DCs in combination with poly-ICLC is safe and induces a measurable tumor specific T cell population in patients with advanced PC.

37285228,Pre-Diagnosis Pain in Patients With Pancreatic Cancer Signals the Need for Aggressive Symptom Management.,"OBJECTIVE: This study assessed the impact of pancreatic cancer (PC) pain on associated symptoms, activities, and resource utilization from 2016 to 2020 in an online patient registry. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Responses from PC patient volunteers (N = 1978) were analyzed from online surveys in a cross-sectional study. Comparisons were performed between PC patient groups reporting, (1) the presence vs. absence of pre-diagnosis PC pain, (2) high (4-8) vs. low (0-3) pain intensity scores on an 11-point numerical rating scale (NRS), and (3) year of PC diagnosis (2010-2020). Descriptive statistics and all bivariate analyses were performed using Chi-square or Fisher's Exact tests. RESULTS: PC pain was the most frequently reported pre-diagnosis symptom (62%). Pre-diagnostic PC pain was reported more frequently by women, those with a younger age at diagnosis, and those with PC that spread to the liver and peritoneum. Those with pre-diagnostic PC pain vs. those without reported higher pain intensities (2.64 +/- 2.54 vs.1.56 +/- 2.01 NRS mean +/- SD, respectively, P = .0039); increased frequencies of post-diagnosis symptoms of cramping after meals, feelings of indigestion, and weight loss (P = .02-.0001); and increased resource utilization in PC pain management: (ER visits N = 86 vs. N = 6, P = .018 and analgesic prescriptions, P < .03). The frequency of high pain intensity scores was not decreased over a recent 11-year span. CONCLUSIONS: PC pain continues to be a prominent PC symptom. Patients reporting pre-diagnosis PC pain experience increased GI metastasis, symptoms burden, and are often undertreated.

23256481,Salvage chemoradiotherapy after primary chemotherapy for locally advanced pancreatic cancer: a single-institution retrospective analysis.,"BACKGROUND: There is no consensus on the indication for salvage chemoradiotherapy (CRT) after failure of primary chemotherapy for locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC). Here we report on the retrospective analysis of patients who received salvage CRT after primary chemotherapy for LAPC. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of salvage CRT after primary chemotherapy for LAPC. METHODS: Thirty patients who underwent salvage CRT, after the failure of primary chemotherapy for LAPC, were retrospectively enrolled from 2004 to 2011 at the authors' institution. All the patients had histologically confirmed pancreatic adenocarcinoma. RESULTS: Primary chemotherapy was continued until progression or emergence of unacceptable toxicity. Eventually, 26 patients (87%) discontinued primary chemotherapy because of local tumor progression, whereas four patients (13%) discontinued chemotherapy because of interstitial pneumonitis caused by gemcitabine. After a median period of 7.9 months from starting chemotherapy, 30 patients underwent salvage CRT combined with either S-1 or 5-FU. Toxicities were generally mild and self-limiting. Median survival time (MST) from the start of salvage CRT was 8.8 months. The 6 month, 1-year and 2-year survival rates from the start of CRT were 77%, 33% and 26%, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that a lower pre-CRT serum CA 19-9 level (</= 1000 U/ml; p = 0.009) and a single regimen of primary chemotherapy (p = 0.004) were independent prognostic factors for survival after salvage CRT. The MST for the entire patient population from the start of primary chemotherapy was 17.8 months, with 2- and 3-year overall survival rates of 39% and 22%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: CRT had moderate anti-tumor activity and an acceptable toxicity profile in patients with LAPC, even after failure of gemcitabine-based primary chemotherapy. If there are any signs of failure of primary chemotherapy without distant metastasis, salvage CRT could be a treatment of choice as a second-line therapy.

34638326,Clinical and Tumor Characteristics of Patients with High Serum Levels of Growth Differentiation Factor 15 in Advanced Pancreatic Cancer.,"We aimed to evaluate the association of circulating growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15) with cachexia symptoms and the biological activity of advanced pancreatic cancer (APC). Treatment-naive patients with liver metastasis of APC or with benign pancreatic disease were retrospectively analyzed. Clinical data, blood samples, and biopsy specimens of liver metastasis were collected prior to anti-cancer treatment. Serum GDF-15 levels and multiple protein expressions in lysates extracted from liver metastasis were measured by enzyme-linked immuno-sorbent assay and reverse-phase protein array, respectively. The cut-off for serum GDF-15 was determined as 3356.6 pg/mL, the mean plus two standard deviations for benign pancreatic disease. The high-GDF-15 group was characterized as showing low Karnofsky performance status (KPS) (p = 0.037), poor Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG-PS) (p = 0.049), severe appetite loss (p = 0.011), and high serum levels of carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (p = 0.019) and C-reactive protein (p = 0.009). Tumors of the high-GDF-15 group expressed high levels of phosphorylated (p)JNK (p = 0.007) and pAkt (p = 0.040). APC patients with high serum GDF-15 showed signatures of cachexia and activation of the signaling pathways involving Akt and JNK in the tumor. This study indicated circulating GDF-15 could be associated with cachectic symptoms in APC.",,Suzuki H; Mitsunaga S; Ikeda M; Aoyama T; Yoshizawa K; Yoshimatsu H; Kawai N; Masuda M; Miura T; Ochiai A,Cancers,2021,Sep,Cancers (Basel). 2021 Sep 28;13(19):4842. doi: 10.3390/cancers13194842.,Switzerland,371,8507697
32742851,Diabetes Mellitus in the Middle-Aged and Elderly Population (>45 Years) and Its Association With Pancreatic Cancer: An Updated Review.,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) and pancreatic cancer (PC) in the elderly are widely considered to be interrelated. New-onset diabetes (NOD) patients are considered a high-risk group for the development of PC within three years of diagnosis. We reviewed the literature to determine the pathophysiological association between DM and PC, which can help in the development of screening tests for early PC diagnosis in the elderly with NOD. We also studied the potential associations between them after pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) or pancreatic resection. We collected studies published in the last five years in PubMed that are relevant to DM and PC in the elderly. We mainly focused on the pathophysiology and intracellular mechanisms involved between NOD and PC. We illustrated the clinical signs and immunological and metabolic biomarkers that can be used to diagnose early PC in the elderly with NOD. In the 34 studies we reviewed, five showed that long-term diabetes mellitus (LTDM) increases the risk of PC. Six studies showed that NOD in the elderly is an early sign of PC. Fourteen studies proposed that clinical signs and biomarker levels should be used to determine the high-risk risk group for PC among NOD patients. Six studies reported that NOD is associated with the worst outcomes postoperatively, and three studies showed that patients developed DM after pancreatic resection. LTDM is considered an independent risk factor for PC development in the elderly. NOD is a consequence and maybe the only early presenting sign of PC. Screening protocols and tests should be used in clinical practice to determine the proportion of NOD patients who should undergo further testing for early diagnosis of PC. DM and PC are also co-related postoperatively and patients should be monitored for impaired glucose levels, overall survival, and mortality.",,Kaleru T; Vankeshwaram VK; Maheshwary A; Mohite D; Khan S,Cureus,2020,Jun,Cureus. 2020 Jun 28;12(6):e8884. doi: 10.7759/cureus.8884.,United States,430,7388804
28105537,Procedures and recommended times in the care process of the patient with pancreatic cancer: PAN-TIME consensus between scientific societies.,"PURPOSE: Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a disease with bad prognosis. It is usually diagnosed at advanced stages and its treatment is complex. The aim of this consensus document was to provide recommendations by experts that would ameliorate PC diagnosis, reduce the time to treatment, and optimize PC management by interdisciplinary teams. METHODS: As a consensus method, we followed the modified Delphi methodology. A scientific committee of experts provided 40 statements that were submitted in two rounds to a panel of 87 specialists of 12 scientific societies. RESULTS: Agreement was reached for 39 of the 40 proposed statements (97.5%). CONCLUSIONS: Although a screening of the asymptomatic population is not a feasible option, special attention to potential symptoms during primary care could ameliorate early diagnostic. It is especially important to decrease the period until diagnostic tests are performed. This consensus could improve survival in PC patients by decreasing the time to diagnose and time to treatment and by the implementation of multidisciplinary teams.","*Consensus; Guideline Adherence/*standards; Humans; Interdisciplinary Communication; Pancreatic Neoplasms/*therapy; Patient Care Team/*standards; Practice Patterns, Physicians'/*standards; *Societies, Scientific",Vera R; Ferrandez A; Ferrer CJ; Flores C; Joaquin C; Lopez S; Martin T; Martin E; Marzo M; Sarrion A; Vaquero E; Zapatero A; Aparicio J,Clinical & translational oncology : official publication of the Federation of Spanish Oncology Societies and of the National Cancer Institute of Mexico,2017,Jul,Clin Transl Oncol. 2017 Jul;19(7):834-843. doi: 10.1007/s12094-016-1609-7.

37740620,Shared decision making with Oncologists and Palliative care specialists (SOP) model help advanced pancreatic cancer patients reaching goal concordant care: A prospective cohort study.,"BACKGROUND: Pancreatic cancer is often diagnosed at a late stage with a poor prognosis due to insidious symptoms and lack of evidence-based screening in general population. Palliative care's acceptance in Asian cultures is hindered by misconceptions and ineffective communication about management that improve quality of life other than cancer directed treatment. Our study aimed to determine the effect of the Shared decision-making with Oncologists and Palliative care specialists (SOP) model developed from the traditional shared decision-making (SDM) model on the palliative care acceptance rate and medical resource utilization. METHODS: This is a prospective cohort study implementing the SOP model at the National Taiwan University Hospital from January 2018 to December 2019 for patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. Medical resource utilization was defined and recorded as the rate of hospitalization, emergency room (ER), and intensive care unit admissions. We compared the results between two groups: patients who received the SOP model in 2019 and patients who did not receive it in 2018. RESULTS: 137 patients with advanced pancreatic cancer were included in our study. The result showed that the acceptance rate of palliative care significantly increased from 50% to 78.69% after the SOP model (p = 0.01). The hospitalization rate did not show a significant difference between 2018 (93.42%, 95% CI: 0.88-0.99) and 2019 (93.44%, 95% CI: 0.87-1.00). 83.61% (95% CI: 0.74-0.93) of our patients in 2019 had at least one ER visit; the rate was 81.5% (95% CI: 0.73-0.91) in 2018 (p = 0.28). The percentage of patients admitted to the ICU increased from 3.95% in 2018 to 8.2% (95% CI: -0.05-0.08) in 2019 (95% CI: 0.11-0.15) (p = 0.00). The hospitalization and ER visit showed no statistically difference between 2 years. CONCLUSIONS: The modified SOP model markedly augmented palliative care's acceptance of patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. Adoption of the SOP model would provide these patients a more proactive and systematic approach to deliver needed healthcare.","Humans; Palliative Care/methods; Decision Making, Shared; Quality of Life; Goals; Prospective Studies; *Pancreatic Neoplasms/therapy; *Oncologists; Decision Making",Tseng YL; Lin YC; Hsu WJ; Kang YC; Su HY; Cheng SY; Tsai JS; Chiu TY; Huang HL,Cancer medicine,2023,Oct,Cancer Med. 2023 Oct;12(19):20119-20128. doi: 10.1002/cam4.6590.

30203372,"Conversion surgery for an initially unresectable, locally advanced pancreatic cancer after induction chemotherapy and carbon-ion radiotherapy: a case report.","BACKGROUND: Pancreatic cancer has a very high mortality rate worldwide, and about 30-40% of all patients have extensive vascular involvement at initial diagnosis that precludes surgical intervention. Here, we describe our experience in a patient with locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC) who underwent R0 conversion surgery after undergoing a combination of chemotherapy and carbon-ion radiotherapy (CIRT), which led to long-term relapse-free survival (23 months). CASE PRESENTATION: A 41-year-old woman presented a month ago with epigastralgia referred to our facility and was subsequently diagnosed with pancreatic cancer cStage III (Ph, TS2 (35 mm), cT4, cCH1, cDU1, cS1, cRP1, cPL1, cVsm0, cAsm1, cN0, cM0) that was also categorized as an unresectable LAPC. She immediately underwent 3 cycles of induction chemotherapy (gemcitabine + nanoparticle albumin-bound (nab-) paclitaxel) followed by CIRT with concurrent gemcitabine. Although significant shrinkage of the primary tumor occurred, frequent cholangitis due to duodenal stenosis of unknown etiology prevented continued chemotherapy, and 9 months after the first visit, she underwent a radical, subtotal, stomach-preserving, pancreaticoduodenectomy (SSPPD). Histopathologic examination of the resected tissue revealed a R0 resection with a histological response of Evans grade IIB. She was administered an almost full dose of S-1 as adjuvant chemotherapy for 6 months and has shown no signs of recurrence in 23 months. CONCLUSIONS: We report a first case of successful conversion surgery for an initially unresectable LAPC after rapid induction GEM + nab-PTX chemotherapy followed by CIRT. Rapid induction GEM + nab-PTX chemotherapy followed by CIRT for LAPC might be a safe and effective treatment option.",,Fujishiro T; Mashiko T; Masuoka Y; Yamada M; Furukawa D; Yazawa N; Kawashima Y; Ogawa M; Hirabayashi K; Nakagohri T,Surgical case reports,2018,Sep,Surg Case Rep. 2018 Sep 10;4(1):112. doi: 10.1186/s40792-018-0522-4.,Japan,352,6134575
39267824,Weakly supervised large-scale pancreatic cancer detection using multi-instance learning.,"INTRODUCTION: Early detection of pancreatic cancer continues to be a challenge due to the difficulty in accurately identifying specific signs or symptoms that might correlate with the onset of pancreatic cancer. Unlike breast or colon or prostate cancer where screening tests are often useful in identifying cancerous development, there are no tests to diagnose pancreatic cancers. As a result, most pancreatic cancers are diagnosed at an advanced stage, where treatment options, whether systemic therapy, radiation, or surgical interventions, offer limited efficacy. METHODS: A two-stage weakly supervised deep learning-based model has been proposed to identify pancreatic tumors using computed tomography (CT) images from Henry Ford Health (HFH) and publicly available Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) data sets. In the first stage, the nnU-Net supervised segmentation model was used to crop an area in the location of the pancreas, which was trained on the MSKCC repository of 281 patient image sets with established pancreatic tumors. In the second stage, a multi-instance learning-based weakly supervised classification model was applied on the cropped pancreas region to segregate pancreatic tumors from normal appearing pancreas. The model was trained, tested, and validated on images obtained from an HFH repository with 463 cases and 2,882 controls. RESULTS: The proposed deep learning model, the two-stage architecture, offers an accuracy of 0.907   +/-   0.01, sensitivity of 0.905   +/-   0.01, specificity of 0.908   +/-   0.02, and AUC (ROC) 0.903   +/-   0.01. The two-stage framework can automatically differentiate pancreatic tumor from non-tumor pancreas with improved accuracy on the HFH dataset. DISCUSSION: The proposed two-stage deep learning architecture shows significantly enhanced performance for predicting the presence of a tumor in the pancreas using CT images compared with other reported studies in the literature.",,Mandal S; Balraj K; Kodamana H; Arora C; Clark JM; Kwon DS; Rathore AS,Frontiers in oncology,2024,,Front Oncol. 2024 Aug 29;14:1362850. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2024.1362850. eCollection 2024.,Switzerland,457,11390448
36552920,Effectiveness of Abdominal Ultrasonography for Improving the Prognosis of Pancreatic Cancer during Medical Checkup: A Single Center Retrospective Analysis.,"Recent advancements in surgical and anti-cancer therapies have provided significant hope of long survival in patients with pancreatic cancer (PC). To realize this hope, routine medical checkups of asymptomatic people should be performed to identify operable PCs. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of medical checkups using abdominal ultrasonography (US). We retrospectively analyzed 374 patients with PC at our institute between 2010 and 2021. We divided these patients into several groups according to the diagnostic approach and compared their background and prognosis. These groups comprised PCs diagnosed through (a) symptoms, 242 cases; (b) US during medical checkup for asymptomatic individuals, 17; and other means. Of the 374 patients, 192 were men (51.3%), and the median age was 74 years (34-105). Tumors were located in the pancreatic tail in 67 patients (17.9%). Excision ratio and 5-year survival rate were significantly better in group (b) than in (a) (58.8% vs. 23.1%, p < 0.01 and 42.2% vs. 9.4%, p < 0.001, respectively). The prognosis of patients diagnosed using US during medical checkup was better than that of patients identified through symptomatic presentation of PC. US for asymptomatic individuals with PC might be one of the useful modalities for promoting better prognosis of PCs.",,Yamaguchi A; Kato N; Sugata S; Hamada T; Furuya N; Mizumoto T; Tamaru Y; Kusunoki R; Kuwai T; Kouno H; Toyota N; Sudo T; Kuraoka K; Kohno H,"Diagnostics (Basel, Switzerland)",2022,Nov,Diagnostics (Basel). 2022 Nov 23;12(12):2913. doi: 10.3390/diagnostics12122913.,Switzerland,259,9777348
37155993,Pancreatic Enzyme Replacement and Nutritional Support With n﻿ab-Paclitaxel-based First-Line Chemotherapy Regimens in Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer.,"BACKGROUND: At diagnosis, more than 80% of patients with pancreatic cancer (PC) suffer from significant weight loss due to malnutrition which is a major concern for patient management, and this may negatively impact treatment outcomes and patient prognosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed an observational, retrospective study on patients with metastatic PC (mPC) undergoing first-line chemotherapy with nab-Paclitaxel containing schedules and receiving or not receiving nutritional support (NS) and pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) to investigate their relevance in this setting. RESULTS: We observed that PERT and ancillary dietary interventions are related to longer overall survival (OS; median: 16.5 vs. 7.5 months, P < .001) and have a significant, independent, prognostic impact for better outcomes (P = .013), independently from the therapeutic regimen. Furthermore, PERT and NS prevented weight loss during chemotherapy and obtained an improvement of nutritional parameters such as phase angle and free-fat mass index, after 3 months of anticancer treatment. Consistently, the positive impact on OS correlated also with the prevention of Karnofsky performance status deterioration and a lower incidence of maldigestion-related symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that an early and well-conducted NS in patients with mPC may impact on survival and preserve performance status, thus improving quality of life.",Humans; *Gemcitabine; Deoxycytidine; Retrospective Studies; Quality of Life; *Pancreatic Neoplasms/pathology; Nutritional Support; Paclitaxel/adverse effects; Weight Loss; Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects; Albumins,Giordano G; Cincione RI; Losavio F; Senia T; Aquilini Mummolo A; Pacilli M; Lizzi V; Bruno G; Piscazzi A; Conteduca V; Landriscina M,The oncologist,2023,Sep,Oncologist. 2023 Sep 7;28(9):e793-e800. doi: 10.1093/oncolo/oyad101.,England,413,10485404
38694319,Pancreatic cancer: from early detection to personalized treatment approaches.,"Pancreatic cancer is notorious for its persistently poor prognosis and health outcomes, so some of the questions that may be begged are ""Why is it mostly diagnosed at end stage?"", ""What could we possibly do with the advancing technology in today's world to detect early pancreatic cancer and intervene?"", and ""Are there any implementation of the existing novel imaging technologies?"". Well, to start with, this is in part because the majority of patients presented would already have reached a locally advanced or metastatic stage at the time of diagnosis due to its highly aggressive characteristics and lack of symptoms. Due to this striking disparity in survival, advancements in early detection and intervention are likely to significantly increase patients' survival. Presently, screening is frequently used in high-risk individuals in order to obtain an early pancreatic cancer diagnosis. Having a thorough understanding of the pathogenesis and risk factors of pancreatic cancer may enable us to identify individuals at high risk, diagnose the disease early, and begin treatment promptly. In this review, the authors outline the clinical hurdles to early pancreatic cancer detection, describe high-risk populations, and discuss current screening initiatives for high-risk individuals. The ultimate goal of this current review is to study the roles of both traditional and novel imaging modalities for early pancreatic cancer detection. A lot of the novel imaging techniques mentioned seem promising, but they need to be put to the test on a large scale and may need to be combined with other non-invasive biomarkers before they can be widely used.",,Khayat S; Choudhary K; Claude Nshimiyimana J; Gurav J; Hneini A; Nazir A; Chaito H; Wojtara M; Uwishema O,Annals of medicine and surgery (2012),2024,May,Ann Med Surg (Lond). 2024 Apr 4;86(5):2866-2872. doi: 10.1097/MS9.0000000000002011. eCollection 2024 May.,England,518,11060269
27142076,Transpapillary biliary biopsy for malignant biliary strictures: comparison between cholangiocarcinoma and pancreatic cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Tissue sampling for biliary stricture is important for differential diagnosis and further treatment. This study aims to assess the differences of transpapillary biliary biopsy for malignant biliary strictures between cholangiocarcinoma and pancreatic cancer. METHODS: From January 2010 to December 2013, we retrospectively studied 79 patients who suffered from biliary strictures and received transpapillary forceps biopsy after sphincterotomy for tissue sampling. The diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of forceps biopsy were calculated in all cases for both cholangiocarcinoma and pancreatic cancer patients. Possible factors that distinguish malignant strictures from benign strictures and which could affect the accuracy of tissue sampling were analyzed. RESULTS: There are 65 malignant and 14 benign biliary stricture patients enrolled. The malignant group has a significantly higher serum bilirubin level than the benign group, but age, clinical presentation, level of serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), carbohydrate antigen (CA) 19-9, and alkaline phosphatase are not. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of forceps biopsy for biliary stricture are 53.85, 100, 100, and 31.82%, respectively. The cholangiocarcinoma group has a higher sensitivity (73.53 versus 29.17%, p < 0.001), older age, lower CA 19-9 level, and more common hepatic duct strictures than the pancreatic group. The age, serum CEA, CA 19-9 and the alkaline phosphatase level, serum bilirubin level >10 mg/dL, tissue sampling >==3 are not significant factors affecting diagnostic accuracy in forceps biopsy for pancreatobiliary strictures. There is neither major bleeding nor perforation in our study. CONCLUSIONS: Transpapillary forceps biopsy of biliary strictures after sphincterotomy for tissue sampling is safe and a significantly higher sensitive method in cholangiocarcinoma but not in pancreatic cancer.","Aged; Bile Duct Neoplasms/complications/*diagnosis; Bile Ducts, Intrahepatic/*pathology; Biopsy; Cholangiocarcinoma/complications/*diagnosis; Cholangiopancreatography, Endoscopic Retrograde; Constriction, Pathologic/etiology/*pathology/surgery; Cytodiagnosis; Diagnosis, Differential; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Male; Neoplasm Staging; Pancreatic Neoplasms/complications/*diagnosis; Prognosis; Retrospective Studies",Chen WM; Wei KL; Chen YS; Chang PJ; Tung SY; Chang TS; Huang HC; Shen CH; Hsieh YY; Wu CS,World journal of surgical oncology,2016,May,World J Surg Oncol. 2016 May 4;14:140. doi: 10.1186/s12957-016-0883-8.,England,325,4855757
35330477,Sensory Ion Channel Candidates Inform on the Clinical Course of Pancreatic Cancer and Present Potential Targets for Repurposing of FDA-Approved Agents.,"Background: Transient receptor potential channels (TRPs) have been demonstrated to take on functions in pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD) biology. However, little data are available that validate the potential of TRP in a clinical translational setting. Methods: A TRPs-related gene signature was constructed based on the Cox regression using a TCGA-PAAD cohort and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) was used to evaluate the predictive ability of this model. Core genes of the signature were screened by a protein-to-protein interaction (PPI) network, and expression validated by two independent datasets. The mutation analysis and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) were conducted. Virtual interventions screening was performed to discover substance candidates for the identified target genes. Results: A four TRPs-related gene signature, which contained MCOLN1, PKD1, TRPC3, and TRPC7, was developed and the area under the curve (AUC) was 0.758. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that patients with elevated signature score classify as a high-risk group featuring significantly shorter recurrence free survival (RFS) time, compared to the low-risk patients (p < 0.001). The gene prediction model also had a good predictive capability for predicting shortened overall survival (OS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) (AUC = 0.680 and AUC = 0.739, respectively). GSEA enrichment revealed the core genes of the signature, TRPC3 and TRPC7, were involved in several cancer-related pathways. TRPC3 mRNA is elevated in cancer tissue compared to control tissue and augmented in tumors with lymph node invasion compared to tumors without signs of lymph node invasion. Virtual substance screening of FDA approved compounds indicates that four small molecular compounds might be potentially selective not only for TRPC3 protein but also as a potential binding partner to TRPC7 protein. Conclusions: Our computational pipeline constructed a four TRP-related gene signature that enables us to predict clinical prognostic value of hitherto unrecognized biomarkers for PAAD. Sensory ion channels TRPC3 and TRPC7 could be the potential therapeutic targets in pancreatic cancer and TRPC3 might be involved in dysregulating mitochondrial functions during PAAD genesis.",,Shi W; Li C; Wartmann T; Kahlert C; Du R; Perrakis A; Brunner T; Croner RS; Kahlert UD,Journal of personalized medicine,2022,Mar,J Pers Med. 2022 Mar 16;12(3):478. doi: 10.3390/jpm12030478.,Switzerland,380,8950951

Globally, the incidence of pancreatic cancer is projected to increase to 18.6 per 100000 in 2050, with the average annual growth of 1.1%, meaning that pancreatic cancer will pose a significant public health burden. Due to the special anatomical location of the pancreas, the development of pancreatic cancer is usually diagnosed at a late stage with obvious clinical symptoms. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of the risk factors for pancreatic cancer is of great clinical significance for effective prevention of pancreatic cancer.

24849506,Selected cytokines in patients with pancreatic cancer: a preliminary report.,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: Recent experimental studies have suggested that various cytokines may be important players in the development and progression of pancreatic cancer. However, these findings have not yet been verified in a clinical setting. METHODS: In this study, we examined the levels of a broad panel of cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, IL-17, and IL-23, as well as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) in patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma (n=43), other pancreatic malignancies (neuroendocrine [n=10] and solid pseudopapillary tumors [n=3]), and healthy individuals (n=41). RESULTS: We found that there were higher levels of IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and TNFalpha in patients with pancreatic cancer compared to healthy controls (for all, at least p<0.03). Cancer patients had lower IL-23 concentrations than healthy individuals and patients diagnosed with other types of malignancies (for both, p=0.002). Levels of IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and IL-23 were significantly associated with the direct number of circulating bone marrow (BM)-derived mesenchymal or very small embryonic/epiblast-like stem cells (SCs) in patients with pancreatic cancer. Moreover, our study identified a potential ability of IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-23, and TNFalpha levels to enable discrimination of pancreatic cancer from other pancreatic tumors and diseases, including acute and chronic pancreatitis and post-pancreatitis cysts (with sensitivity and specificity ranging between 70%-82%).

METHODS: This was a methodological and cross-sectional study. We established the C-PACADI score following Beaton's translation guidelines and then included 209 patients with PC to evaluate C-PACADI's reliability and validity. RESULTS: The Cronbach's alpha coefficient of the C-PACADI score was 0.822. The correlation coefficient between ""skin itchiness"" score and the total score was 0.224, while the correlation coefficients ranged from 0.515 to 0.688 (P ​< ​0.001) for all the other items. The item content validity index and the scale content validity index, evaluated by eight experts were 0.875 and 0.98, respectively.

There are many factors such as obesity, diabetes, alcohol consumption, and the adoption of sedentary lifestyles that are driving pancreatic cancer (PC) to become one of the leading causes of cancer mortality in the United States. PC is notorious for its generic symptoms and late-stage presentation with rapid metastasis. The connection between T2DM and the risk of PC development is multifaceted and complex. Some of the proposed theories reveal that chronic inflammation, insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, hyperglycemia, and abnormalities in the insulin and insulin-like growth factor axis (IGF) contribute to the disease association between these two conditions. This literature review aims to highlight relevant studies and explore the molecular mechanisms involved in the etiology of diabetes and its impact on PC development, as well as the role of anti-diabetic agents on PC. Despite extensive studies, the exact interaction between T2DM and PC remains obscure and will need further investigation. According to current knowledge, there is a substantial link between diabetes, obesity, and dietary patterns in the development and progression of PC. Consequently, focusing our efforts on preventive measures by reducing modifiable risk factors remains the most effective strategy to reduce the risk of PC at this time. Antidiabetic drugs can have various effects on the occurrence and prognosis of PC with metformin offering a clear benefit of inhibiting PC and insulin increasing the risk of PC. The development of future novel therapies will require a deeper knowledge of the triggering mechanisms and interplay between these two disease states.",,George S; Jean-Baptiste W; Yusuf Ali A; Inyang B; Koshy FS; George K; Poudel P; Chalasani R; Goonathilake MR; Waqar S; Mohammed L,Cureus,2022,Jun,Cureus. 2022 Jun 24;14(6):e26288. doi: 10.7759/cureus.26288. eCollection 2022 Jun.,United States,442,9308974
37032728,Artificial intelligence as a noninvasive tool for pancreatic cancer prediction and diagnosis.,"Pancreatic cancer (PC) has a low incidence rate but a high mortality, with patients often in the advanced stage of the disease at the time of the first diagnosis. If detected, early neoplastic lesions are ideal for surgery, offering the best prognosis. Preneoplastic lesions of the pancreas include pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia and mucinous cystic neoplasms, with intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms being the most commonly diagnosed. Our study focused on predicting PC by identifying early signs using noninvasive techniques and artificial intelligence (AI). A systematic English literature search was conducted on the PubMed electronic database and other sources. We obtained a total of 97 studies on the subject of pancreatic neoplasms. The final number of articles included in our study was 44, 34 of which focused on the use of AI algorithms in the early diagnosis and prediction of pancreatic lesions. AI algorithms can facilitate diagnosis by analyzing massive amounts of data in a short period of time. Correlations can be made through AI algorithms by expanding image and electronic medical records databases, which can later be used as part of a screening program for the general population. AI-based screening models should involve a combination of biomarkers and medical and imaging data from different sources. This requires large numbers of resources, collaboration between medical practitioners, and investment in medical infrastructures.","Humans; *Carcinoma, Pancreatic Ductal/pathology; Artificial Intelligence; Early Detection of Cancer; *Pancreatic Neoplasms/diagnostic imaging/pathology",Faur AC; Lazar DC; Ghenciu LA,World journal of gastroenterology,2023,Mar,World J Gastroenterol. 2023 Mar 28;29(12):1811-1823. doi: 10.3748/wjg.v29.i12.1811.,United States,517,10080704
38898835,Early detection of pancreatic cancer.,"The diagnosis of pancreatic cancer associates an appalling significance. Detection of preinvasive stage of pancreatic cancer will ameliorate the survival of this deadly disease. Premalignant lesions such as Intraductal Papillary Mucinous Neoplasms or Mucinous Cystic Neoplasms of the pancreas are detectable on imaging exams and this permits their management prior their invasive development. Pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasms (PanIN) are the most frequent precursors of pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC), and its particular type PanIN high-grade represents the malignant non-invasive form of PDAC. Unfortunately, PanINs are not detectable on radiologic exams. Nevertheless, they can associate indirect imaging signs which would rise the diagnostic suspicion. When this suspicion is established, the patient will be enrolled in a follow-up strategy that includes performing of blood test and serial imaging test such as computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, which will cost in the best-case scenario a burden of healthcare systems, and potential mortality in the worst-case scenario when the patient underwent resection surgery, worthless when there is no moderate or high grade dysplasia in the final histopathology. This issue will be avoid having at its disposal a diagnostic technique capable of detecting high-grade PanIN lesions, such is the cytology of pancreatic juice obtained by nasopancreatic intubation. Herein, we review the possibility of detection of early malignant lesions before they become invasive PADC.",,Morera-Ocon FJ,World journal of clinical cases,2024,Jun,World J Clin Cases. 2024 Jun 16;12(17):2935-2938. doi: 10.12998/wjcc.v12.i17.2935.,United States,279,11185363
